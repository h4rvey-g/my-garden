Measures the ratio of urine density over pure water density (normally 1.005â€“1.030) 
- High urine specific gravity: volume loss, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]], presence of large molecules (e.g., glucose, radiocontrast media) 
- Low urine specific gravity: renal failure, [[USMLE/Renal/Diabetes insipidus\|diabetes insipidus]]
