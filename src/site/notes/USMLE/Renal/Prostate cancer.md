# Epidemiology
- Incidence: following skin cancer (i.e., [[USMLE/MSK/Melanoma\|melanoma]] and nonmelanoma combined) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common cancer in men</span> in the US
- Mortality: in 2020, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">second leading cause of cancer deaths</span> in men in the US (after [[USMLE/Respiratory/Lung cancer\|lung cancer]])

# Clinical features
- Advanced prostate cancer can manifest with:
	- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, loss of appetite, clinically significant unintentional weight loss
	- Features of metastatic disease; examples include:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone pain (due to [[USMLE/MSK/Bone metastasis\|bone metastasis]], especially in the lumbosacral spine)</span>![L29238.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L29238.jpg)
		- Neurological deficits (e.g., due to vertebral fracture causing spinal cord compression) 
		- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Nonpitting edema\|Lymphedema]] (caused by obstructing metastases in the lymph nodes)

# Treatment
## [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Androgen]] deprivation
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androgens accelerate the growth of prostate cancer.</span> Androgen deprivation by reduction of testosterone production or inhibition of testosterone binding to the androgen receptor on cancer cells is an important aspect of treating advanced or high-risk prostate cancer.
### Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
- Definition: therapy designed to decrease testosterone production by the testes
- Indications
	- Locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer: primary treatment modality
- Options
	- Medical castration: decreases pituitary stimulation of androgen production by the testes
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Pharmacology/Hypothalamic and pituitary drugs\|GnRH agonists]] (e.g., [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Hypothalamic and pituitary drugs\|leuprolide]])</span>
			- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Hypothalamic and pituitary drugs\|GnRH agonists]] may induce a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">short-term elevation in testosterone</span> that transiently worsens symptoms (testosterone flare). This can be treated with a short course (< 4 weeks) of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">first-generation antiandrogens.</span>
	- Surgical castration: bilateral orchiectomy
- Adverse effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased risk of [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]] and fractures</span> 
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Sexual dysfunction\|Sexual dysfunction]]: loss of libido, erectile dysfunction
	- Change in body image: [[USMLE/Reproductive/Gynecomastia\|gynecomastia]]
### Androgen synthesis inhibitors and androgen receptor antagonists
- Indication: adjunct to ADT in locally advanced and metastatic prostate cancer
- Androgen receptor antagonists (antiandrogen therapy)
	- Mechanism of action: displaces androgens from androgen receptors
	- Commonly used agents: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">apalutamide and enzalutamide (second-generation antiandrogens)</span>

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-generation antiandrogens (flutamide and bicalutamide) are used only for the short-term management of a testosterone flare.</span>
