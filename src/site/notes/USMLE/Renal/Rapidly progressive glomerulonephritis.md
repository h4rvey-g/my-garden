# Etiology
Three classifications, same as [[USMLE/Renal/Nephritic syndrome#Etiology\|Nephritic syndrome#Etiology]]

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Breaks in the glomerular capillary wall and dysfunction of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) → leakage of plasma proteins (e.g., coagulation factors) and passage of inflammatory cells (macrophages, T cells) into Bowman space</span>![L13147.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L13147.jpg)
- Release of inflammatory cytokines → damage to the membrane of Bowman space and passage of cells from the interstitium into Bowman space
- This causes the formation of fibrin clots and proliferation of cells (e.g., macrophages, fibroblasts, neutrophils, epithelial cells) → crescent moon formation → compression of the glomerulus → renal dysfunction

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
- Antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) RPGN:  Linear GBM deposits of IgG and C3 are found on [[USMLE/Renal/Immunofluorescence\|immunofluorescence]].  In some patients, anti-GBM antibodies cross-react with pulmonary alveolar basement membranes, producing pulmonary hemorrhages ([[USMLE/Renal/Goodpasture syndrome\|Goodpasture syndrome]]).
- Immune-complex RPGN:  There is a "lumpy-bumpy" granular pattern of staining for both antibodies (eg, IgG, IgA) and [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] on [[USMLE/Renal/Immunofluorescence\|immunofluorescence]] microscopy.  This can be a complication of [[USMLE/Renal/Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]], [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[USMLE/Renal/IgA nephropathy\|IgA nephropathy]], or [[USMLE/MSK/IgA vasculitis\|Henoch-Schönlein purpura]].
- Pauci-immune RPGN:  There are no immunoglobulin or [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] deposits on the basement membrane. Most patients have elevated serum titers of [[USMLE/Immunology/Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies\|ANCA]].  This condition is often associated with [[USMLE/MSK/Vasculitides\|vasculitides]] (eg, [[USMLE/Blood/Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\|granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], microscopic polyangiitis) but can also be idiopathic.
