# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Auto-antibodies against [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]] type IV</span> in the renal and pulmonary capillary basement membrane
- Possibly triggered by viral infections, lymphoma

---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoptysis</span>
- Cough
- Dyspnea
- [[USMLE/Renal/Nephritic syndrome\|Nephritic syndrome]]
	- Usually presents as [[USMLE/Renal/Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis\|RPGN]] type 1
	- Proliferative glomerulonephritis

# Diagnostics
- Anti-GBM antibodies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemosiderin-filled macrophages in sputum</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to intra-alveolar bleeding. Macrophages that subsequently phagocytose the erythrocytes are called “[[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]] cells.”</span> 
	- These cells may also be detected in the sputum of patients with pulmonary infarction, [[USMLE/MSK/Vasculitides\|vasculitis]], or aspiration of blood.
- Iron deficiency [[USMLE/Blood/Anemia\|anemia]]
