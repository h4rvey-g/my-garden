# Epidemiology
- Most common and severe manifestation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lupus nephritis in [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE)</span>
- Also seen with [[USMLE/Renal/IgA nephropathy\|IgA nephropathy]] and with other inflammatory, autoimmune, or infectious diseases

---
# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Can also be nephritic with nephrotic-range proteinuria (nephritic-[[USMLE/Renal/Nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]])
- Can lead to immune complex [[USMLE/Renal/Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis\|RPGN]]

---
# Diagnostics
- ↓ Serum C3 [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] levels
- ANA, anti-dsDNA antibodies
- LM

	- Characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased glomerular cellularity in more than half of the glomeruli</span>

	- An immunofluorescence pattern containing <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgG, IgM, IgA and C3, C1q</span> is highly characteristic of lupus nephritis and is referred to as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">full-house</span> (三带一对, ie, a poker hand with three of a kind 3 immunoglobulin classes and two of a kind 2 complement components).![Pasted image 20240529112801.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240529112801.png)
	- The full-house pattern reflects the pathogenesis of lupus: loss of immune tolerance to self-antigens (eg, double-stranded DNA) leads to generation of polyclonal autoantibodies that form circulating immune complexes; these deposit in the glomeruli, where they cause local injury by activating the classical complement cascade.
