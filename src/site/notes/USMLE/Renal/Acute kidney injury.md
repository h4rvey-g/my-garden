# Etiology
---
## Intrinsic acute kidney injury
Intrinsic causes include any condition that leads to severe direct kidney damage (∼ 35% of cases of AKI).
>[!info] 
>ATI is an umbrella term indicating a sudden decrease in kidney function. GN, ATN, and ATIN are all causes of ATI.

# Pathophysiology
---
## Prerenal
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased blood supply to kidneys (due to hypovolemia, hypotension, or renal vasoconstriction)</span> → failure of renal vascular autoreg<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>ulation to maintain renal perfusion <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">→ decreased GFR → activation of renin-angiotensin system → increased aldosterone release → increased reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>O → increased [[USMLE/Renal/Urine osmolality\|Urine osmolality]] → secretion of antidiuretic hormone → increased reabsorption of H<sub>2</sub>O and urea</span>
- Creatinine is still secreted in the proximal tubules, so the blood [[USMLE/Renal/BUN-creatinine ratio\|BUN:creatinine ratio]] increases.
## Intrinsic
- Damage to a vascular or tubular component of the nephron → necrosis or apoptosis of tubular cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased reabsorption capacity of electrolytes</span> (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>), water, and/or urea (depending on the location of injury along the tubular system) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased Na<sup>+</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O in the urine</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased [[USMLE/Renal/Urine osmolality\|Urine osmolality]]</span>
## Postrenal
## Four phases of AKI
1. **Initiating event (kidney injury)** (Duration: Hours to days)
    - Symptoms of the underlying illness causing AKI may be present.
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Oliguric or anuric phase (maintenance phase)** (Duration: 1-3 weeks)</span>
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive deterioration of kidney function</span>
        - Reduced urine production (oliguria), < 50 ml/24 hrs = anuria
        - Increased retention of urea and creatinine (azotemia)
    - Complications: fluid retention (pulmonary edema), hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, uremia, lethargy, asterixis
3. **Polyuric/diuretic phase** (Duration: ~ 2 weeks)
    - Glomerular filtration returns to normal, which increases urine production (polyuria), while tubular reabsorption remains disturbed.
    - Complications: loss of electrolytes and water (dehydration, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia)
4. **Recovery phase** (Duration: Months to years)
    - Kidney function and urine production normalize.

## Acute tubular necrosis
- Epidemiology: causes ∼ 85% of intrinsic AKIs
- Location![L43195.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L43195.jpg)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The straight segment of the proximal tubule and the straight segment of the distal tubule (i.e., the thick ascending limb) are particularly susceptible to ischemic damage.</span> 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blood flow in the renal medulla is relatively low</span> compared to that in the renal cortex.
			- Facilitates the development of an osmolality gradient that allows for effective urine concentration
			- Causes medullary <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vulnerability to hypoxia</span> when renal blood flow is decreased (renal ischemia)
	- The convoluted segment of the proximal tubule is particularly susceptible to damage from toxins (but can also damage from ischemia).
		- First encounters toxins
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Descending and ascending limbs are not, as their function is primarily passive.</span>
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ischemic: Injury occurs secondary to decreased renal blood flow.</span>
		- Severe hypotension, especially in the context of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">shock</span>: hypovolemic (e.g., hemorrhage, severe dehydration), septic, cardiogenic (e.g., [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]]), or neurogenic shock
		- Cholesterol embolism (atheroemboli)
	- Toxic: Injury occurs directly due to nephrotoxic substances.
		- Contrast-induced nephropathy
		- Medication: aminoglycosides, cisplatin, amphotericin, lead, ethylene glycol
		- Pigment nephropathy
			- Myoglobinuria due to [[USMLE/Renal/Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome\|rhabdomyolysis]] ([[USMLE/Renal/Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome\|crush syndrome]])
			- Hemoglobinuria associated with hemolysis
- Pathophysiology: necrotic proximal tubular cells fall into the tubular lumen → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">debris obstructs tubules → decreased GFR</span> → sequence of pathophysiological events similar to prerenal failure
