- Immunoglobulin (IG)-mediated membranoproliferative [[USMLE/Renal/Nephritic syndrome\|glomerulonephritis]] (type 1 MPGN)
	- Associated with [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|SLE]], monoclonal gammopathy
- [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|Complement]]-mediated membranoproliferative [[USMLE/Renal/Nephritic syndrome\|glomerulonephritis]] (type 2 MPGN: associated with dense deposit disease (IgG antibodies that stabilize C3 convertase, i.e., C3 nephritic factor, cause a persistent [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] activation, leading to a depletion of C3)
