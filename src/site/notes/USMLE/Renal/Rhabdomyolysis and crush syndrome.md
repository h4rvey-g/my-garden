# Etiology
---
- Traumatic
	- Crush injury
	- Direct injury
- Nontraumatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|Seizures]]</span>
	- Overexertion (e.g., strenuous exercise)
	- Intoxication (e.g., cocaine, heroin, amphetamines, [[USMLE/Neurology/MDMA\|MDMA]], alcohol, carbon monoxide, phencyclidine)
	- Skeletal muscle ischemia
	- Infection
	- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Adverse drug reactions\|Adverse drug reactions]] (e.g., neuroleptics, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Lipid-lowering agents\|statins]])

# Pathophysiology
---
- Rhabdomyolysis → release of the following substances:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and serum myoglobin → pigment nephropathy → [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|acute tubular necrosis]] → [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|acute kidney injury]] (intrinsic)</span>
	- Potassium → cardiac arrhythmia
	- Lactic acid → metabolic acidosis
- Hypovolemia → ↓ renal perfusion → [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|acute kidney injury]] (prerenal)
	- Hypovolemia is predominantly due to third spacing of extracellular fluid into damaged muscle tissue.
- Reperfusion syndrome → compartment syndrome
