| Feature                           | Stress Incontinence                                                                                                       | Urge Incontinence (Overactive Bladder)                                                                                                 | Overflow Incontinence                                                                                    |

| **Etiology**                      | Multiparous women (pelvic floor weakness), post-prostatectomy in men.                                                     | Often idiopathic. Can be associated w/ neurologic d/o (MS, stroke, Parkinson's).                                                       | **BPH** (men), **diabetic neuropathy**, spinal cord injury, anticholinergic meds.                        |
| **Pathophysiology**               | **Urethral hypermobility** or **intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD)**. ↑ intra-abdominal pressure > urethral resistance. | **Detrusor overactivity/instability**. Involuntary bladder contractions.                                                               | **Impaired detrusor contractility** (underactive bladder) or **bladder outlet obstruction** (e.g., BPH). |
| **Classic Presentation**          | Leaks small amounts of urine with **coughing, laughing, sneezing, lifting**. No urge beforehand.                          | Sudden, overwhelming **urge to urinate**, followed by involuntary loss of a large volume of urine. Associated w/ frequency & nocturia. | **Constant dribbling**, incomplete bladder emptying, weak stream. High post-void residual (PVR) volume.  |
| **Dx Evaluation**                 | **Cough stress test:** direct observation of leakage from urethra with coughing. Normal/low PVR.                          | Often a clinical diagnosis. Urodynamic studies show detrusor contractions during filling. Normal/low PVR.                              | **↑ Post-void residual (PVR) volume** on bladder US or catheterization is key finding.                   |
| **1st Line Management**           | **Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegel)**; lifestyle mods (weight loss).                                                  | **Bladder training** (timed voiding); lifestyle mods (↓ caffeine/alcohol).                                                             | **Intermittent or indwelling catheterization** to relieve obstruction/retention.                         |
| **Pharmacotherapy**               | Limited role. Pessaries can be used. Surgery (mid-urethral sling) is definitive.                                          | **Antimuscarinics** (e.g., oxybutynin, tolterodine) or **β3-agonists** (e.g., mirabegron).                                             | **α-blockers** (e.g., tamsulosin) for BPH. **Bethanechol** for atonic bladder (rarely used).             |
| **Buzzwords/Key Differentiators** | "Leaks when I laugh/cough."                                                                                               | "Gotta go NOW!"                                                                                                                        | "Constantly wet," "can't empty." **High PVR**.                                                           |

**Mixed Incontinence:** Features of both stress and urge incontinence. Very common, especially in older women. Treatment is directed at the more predominant symptom first.

**Functional Incontinence:** Patient has normal bladder control but cannot reach the toilet in time due to physical or cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia, severe arthritis). Management involves treating the underlying condition and using scheduled/prompted voiding.

# Epidemiology
- [[USMLE/Renal/Stress incontinence\|Stress incontinence]] and mixed incontinence are the most common types of incontinence in female patients.
- [[USMLE/Renal/Urge incontinence\|Urge incontinence]] is the most common type in male patients.

# Classifications
## Overflow incontinence
### Mechanism
- Impaired (weak) detrusor contractility
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., [[USMLE/Renal/Benign prostatic hyperplasia\|BPH]])</span>
- Both mechanisms can lead to incomplete bladder emptying → bladder overfilling → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronically distended bladder with ↑ bladder pressure → dribbling of urine (leak) when intravesical pressure > outlet resistance</span>
### Clinical features
- Frequent, involuntary intermittent/continuous dribbling of urine in the absence of an urge to urinate
- Occurs only when the bladder is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">full</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postvoid residual urine volume *(seen on ultrasound or with catherization)*</span>
	- Assess for urinary retention via bladder scan (≥200 mL) or straight catheterization yielding ≥200 mL urine output.
### Treatment
- [[USMLE/Renal/Intermittent catheterization\|Intermittent catheterization]]: for scheduled bladder emptying
	- Intermittent -> prevention of catheter-associated [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary tract infections\|UTIs]] and is favored by most patients; indwelling catheters may be considered if necessary.

# Epidemiology
Prevalence increases with age.

# Etiology
- Pathomechanism: outlet incompetence
	- Urethral hypermobility: loss of pelvic floor musculature and/or connective tissue support → weak pelvic floor → inability of the urethra to completely close
	- Intrinsic sphincter deficiency
- Risk factors
	- Multipara
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]] and vaginal deliveries </span>
	- High-impact activity (e.g., jumping, running, hopping)
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Menopause\|Menopause]]
	- Obesity
	- Smoking
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic cough (e.g., [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]])</span>
	- Prostate or pelvic surgery

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Physical activity that causes increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, sneezing, coughing, exercising) leads to loss of urine
- Frequent, predictable, small-volume urine losses with no urge to urinate prior to the leakage

---
# Diagnostics


---
# Treatment
# Conservative treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Kegel exercises </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strengthen Levator ani</span>
- Lifestyle changes (e.g., weight loss, avoiding alcohol and caffeine, smoking cessation)
- Vaginal pessary
# Surgical procedures
- Indicated if conservative treatment does not provide sufficient improvement of symptoms
- Procedure of choice: midurethral sling to elevate the urethra

# Epidemiology
Prevalence increases with age

# Etiology
The condition is caused by sensory or motor dysfunction.
- Idiopathic (most common)
- Neurological conditions

---
# Pathophysiology
Inflammatory conditions (e.g., UTI) or neurogenic disorders → sphincter dysfunction, detrusor overactivity, or overactive bladder  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">autonomous contractions of the detrusor muscle</span> and premature initiation of a normal micturition reflex

---
# Clinical features
- Urinary urgency: sudden urge to urinate 
- Loss of urine without exertion, with urinary tenesmus  → frequent episodes, with variable volumes of urine voided each time

## Neurogenic bladder dysfunction
### Mechanism
detrusor sphincter dyssynergia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Simultaneous contractions of the detrusor muscle and involuntary activation of the urethral sphincter → blockage of bladder outlet</span> → small amounts of urine are pressed through the contracted sphincter muscle → high intravesical pressure along with inappropriate contraction of the urethral sphincter
- Commonly seen in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Multiple sclerosis\|multiple sclerosis]] and spinal cord injury </span>
### Clinical features
- Voiding and/or storage dysfunction, intermittent voiding, urinary retention
- Irregular, small volume incontinence without an associated urge to void (sometimes referred to as reflex incontinence)
## Total incontinence
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Complete loss of sphincter function (due to previous surgery, nerve damage, metastasis) → Urinary leakage occurs at all times</span>

>[!warning] 
>The use of muscarinic agonists may lead to urinary urgency, while the use of sympathomimetics or [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Muscarinic antagonists\|muscarinic antagonists]] may lead to urinary retention, especially if there is an untreated outlet obstruction.

>[!tip] 
>No pharmacological therapies are FDA-approved for [[USMLE/Renal/Stress incontinence\|stress incontinence]]; treatment is primarily conservative with surgery.
