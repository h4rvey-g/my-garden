## Calcium stones
### Calcium oxalate stones
#### Etiology
- Hypercalciuria
- Hyperoxaluria
	- Increased intestinal absorption of oxalate, e.g., due to fatty acid [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]] (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Crohn disease\|Crohn disease]], [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|ulcerative colitis]], [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|short bowel syndrome]])
		- Calcium normally binds oxalate to form calcium oxalate, which is excreted via feces.
		- In conditions associated with fatty acid [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]] due to impaired bile acid reabsorption, calcium preferentially binds free fatty acids, leading to excess free oxalate and, therefore, to increased oxalate absorption. 
	 - [[USMLE/Blood/Vitamin C# Vitamin C toxicity\|Vitamin C# Vitamin C toxicity]]
		 - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Blood/Vitamin C\|Vitamin C]] is metabolized to oxalate</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypocitraturia</span>
	- Citrate inhibits stone formation by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">forming a soluble complex with calcium in the renal tubule, which reduces the amount of free calcium in the urine to bind with oxalate or phosphate.</span> Citrate excretion in the kidney is strongly influenced by pH (systemic, tubular, and intracellular). <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alkalosis increases renal citrate excretion, whereas acidosis decreases it.</span>

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Individuals with higher (but not excessive) calcium intake paradoxically have a lower risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.</span>  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dietary calcium binds oxalate in the gut to form insoluble calcium oxalate</span>, which is eliminated in the feces.  This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduces the amount of oxalate absorbed into the body</span> and excreted in the urine, reducing stone formation.
#### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dumbbell-shaped</span> or octahedron-shaped crystals ![Pasted image 20230817154316.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230817154316.png)
	- The monohydrate calcium oxalate crystal is described as the “picket fence” form. These dumbbells shaped crystals are common in ethylene glycol toxicity. The dihydrate form is octahedral or “envelope” shaped.![Pasted image 20230909155554.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230909155554.png)
- X-ray (or CT): radiopaque stones
>[!tip] 
>Serum calcium can be normal or elevated.
#### Treatment
- Hydration
- Dietary modification
	- Reduced intake of salt (mainly sodium) and animal protein *(Low sodium enhances renal tubular reabsorption of sodium and calcium, decreasing urinary calcium levels. Animal protein consumption increases calcium excretion in urine.)*
	- Reduced intake of oxalate-rich foods and supplemental [[USMLE/Blood/Vitamin C\|vitamin C]]
	- Calcium intake should not be restricted (restriction increases risk of hyperoxaluria, and thereby, the risk for [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thiazide [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]]</span> for recurrent calcium-containing stones with idiopathic hypercalciuria (i.e., no [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypercalcemia\|hypercalcemia]])
- Urine alkalinization (e.g., with potassium citrate)
- Possibly citrate supplementation
### Calcium phosphate stones
#### Etiology
- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism\|Hyperparathyroidism]] (brushite)
- Type 1 [[USMLE/Renal/Renal tubular disorders\|renal tubular acidosis]] (brushite)
- Develop in persistently alkalic urine
#### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: wedge-shaped crystals![Pasted image 20230901152436.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230901152436.png) 
- X-ray (or CT): radiopaque stones
#### Prevention
- Hydration
- Thiazide [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]]
- Diet low in sodium
## Uric acid stones
### Etiology
- [[USMLE/MSK/Gout\|Hyperuricemia]] and hyperuricosuria
	- [[USMLE/MSK/Gout\|Gout]]
	- High cell turnover (e.g., [[USMLE/Renal/Tumor lysis syndrome\|tumor lysis syndrome]], [[USMLE/Blood/Myelodysplastic syndromes\|myelodysplastic syndrome]])
- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]], metabolic syndrome
- Chronic diarrhea
### Diagnosis
- Urine microscopy: rhomboid/needle-shaped crystals ![Pasted image 20230817160628.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230817160628.png)
- X-ray: radiolucent stones
- CT: can be visible but are usually only minimally visible (not as visible as calcium stones)
### Treatment
- Hydration
- Oral chemolitholysis (e.g., potassium citrate) via urine alkalinization 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uric acid (pKa = 5.4) is soluble at physiologic pH, but precipitates in an acidic environment.  The lowest pH along the nephron is found in the distal tubules and collecting ducts; so these are the segments of the nephron that become obstructed by uric acid crystals.</span>  Obstructive uropathy and [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|acute renal failure]] follow.
	- Uric acid stones are unique in that they can usually be dissolved by alkalizing the urine. In other stones, urine alkalinization is used for prophylaxis rather than treatment.
- Low-purine diet
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allopurinol</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
>**U**ric acid stones are radiol**U**cent (x-ray negative).

>[!warning] 
>Uricosuric agents (e.g., probenecid) increase the excretion of uric acid, which can accelerate the formation of stones.
## Cystine stones
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Autosomal recessive defect in cystine-reabsorbing PCT transporter</span> → impaired proximal renal tubular absorption of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dibasic amino acids</span> → [[USMLE/Biochemistry/cystinuria\|Cystinuria]] → cystine stone formation (as cystine is poorly soluble)
- Develop in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">persistently acidic urine</span>
### Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent kidney stones (manifesting with e.g., flank pain) starting <u>in childhood</u></span>
### Diagnosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urine microscopy: hexagonal crystals</span> ![Pasted image 20231106145828.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231106145828.png)
- X-ray (or CT)
	- Weakly radiopaque stones
	- Possibly staghorn calculi
- Positive cyanide nitroprusside test
## Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate stones)
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Upper [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary tract infections\|UTI]] with urease-producing bacteria</span> such as Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and/or [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pseudomonas\|Pseudomonas]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">These bacteria convert urea to ammonia → elevated ammonia causing alkaline urine → precipitation of the ammonium magnesium phosphate salt → crystal and stone formation</span>
		- Urea → 2 NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>
		- NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> + OH<sup>−</sup>
	- Grow rapidly into a branched staghorn calculus that fills the renal calyces and pelvis.
	- Over time, the affected kidney can atrophy due to recurrent infection and chronic obstructive nephropathy.
### Treatment
- Antibiotic treatment of [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary tract infections\|urinary tract infections]]
- Hydration
- Urine acidification
- Usually require surgical stone removal
