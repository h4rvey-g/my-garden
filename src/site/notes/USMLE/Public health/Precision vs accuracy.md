- Precision (reliability) is the ability of a test to reproduce identical or similar results with repeated measurements (bottom half of figure).
- Accuracy (validity) is the ability of a test to measure what it is supposed to measure.  For a new test to be accurate, its results should be equivalent to the results obtained with a gold standard (eg, best conventional test available) on the same individual (right half of figure).
