| | **Disease Present (Cases)** | **Disease Absent (Controls)** | **Row Total** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Exposed** | a | b | a + b |
| **Not Exposed** | c | d | c + d |
| **Column Total**| a + c | b + d | **Grand Total** |

- **Relative Risk (RR)** compares **PROBABILITY**.
    
    - `(a/a+c)` is the probability of exposure in one group.
    - It's a ratio of two probabilities.
- **Odds Ratio (OR)** compares **ODDS**.
    
    - **Odds** = (Number of times an event happens) / (Number of times it doesn't).
    - `(a/c)` are the odds of exposure in the disease group (cases).
    - `(b/d)` are the odds of exposure in the control group.
    - The OR is the ratio of these two odds.
