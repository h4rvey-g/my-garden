# Health insurance basics

## Out-of-pocket expenses
- Definition: health care costs that are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">paid by an individual</span> rather than by an insurance company, e.g., deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments
- Out-of-pocket maximum
	- A limit on the amount of money that an individual has to pay for covered health care services in a year (not including premiums).
	- After this amount is reached, all covered health services are paid in full by the health plan for the rest of that plan year.
	- Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance apply to the out-of-pocket maximum.
### Copayment
- A fixed fee that must be paid to receive covered care
- Example: $40 every time you see a specialist
### Coinsurance
- A fixed percentage that must be paid by the insured
- Example: if your coinsurance is 25%, and a doctor bills insurance $100 for a visit, you are responsible for $25
### Deductible
- A fixed amount that must be paid out of pocket BEFORE insurance pays for your care
- Example: if your deductible is $4,000, and you haven't met it yet, and your doctor bills you for $265, you are responsible for paying the entirety of the $265. You have now paid $265 out of $4,000 toward your deductible.
### Example Scenario:
Imagine you have a health insurance plan with the following features:
- Annual deductible: $2,000
- Coinsurance: 20% after deductible
- Specialist copay: $50 per visit

#### Throughout the Year:

**January:**
- You visit your primary care physician for a routine check-up, which costs $200
- Since you haven't met your deductible yet, you pay the full $200
- Your remaining deductible: $1,800

**March:**
- You see a specialist for a consultation
- You pay a $50 copay (this is separate from and doesn't count toward your deductible)
- The specialist's services cost $300, which goes toward your deductible
- You pay the full $300 plus the $50 copay, totaling $350
- Your remaining deductible: $1,500

**July:**
- You need an outpatient procedure costing $2,000
- You pay the remaining $1,500 to meet your deductible
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">For the remaining $500 of the procedure cost, your coinsurance kicks in</span>
- You pay 20% of $500 = $100
- Insurance covers the other 80% = $400
- Total you pay: $1,600

**September:**
- You see a specialist again for follow-up
- You pay only the $50 copay
- The specialist bills insurance $250
- Since your deductible is met, coinsurance applies
- You pay 20% of $250 = $50 (coinsurance)
- Your total payment: $100 ($50 copay + $50 coinsurance)

# Health care payment models

| Payment Model                  | Description                                                                                          | Provider Risk                                                                                                    | Patient Experience                                           | Examples/Usage                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fee-for-service**            | Payment made for each individual service provided                                                    | Low risk for providers; incentivizes volume of services                                                          | May lead to unnecessary services; less coordination of care  | Traditional insurance model; Medicare Part B                                                          |
| **Discounted fee-for-service** | Payment for each individual service at a discounted rate pre-determined between providers and payers | Moderate provider risk due to discounted rates                                                                   | Similar to fee-for-service but with potentially lower copays | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PPOs commonly use this model</span>                   |
| **Global payment**             | Single payment covers all expenses for a specific episode of care                                    | Higher risk for providers if complications arise                                                                 | Simpler billing; transparent total cost                      | Common for elective surgeries including pre- and post-operative care                                  |
| **Bundled payment**            | Set payment amount for a service to be divided among all involved providers/facilities               | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High risk for providers if costs exceed the bundle amount</span> | Potentially better care coordination across providers        | Joint replacements, cardiac procedures, maternity care                                                |
| **Capitation**                 | Fixed payment per patient per time period regardless of services used                                | Highest risk for providers; may limit unnecessary care                                                           | May improve preventive care; potential for undertreatment    | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Common in HMOs</span>; Primary care capitation models |

Key differences:
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Risk allocation**: Fee-for-service puts risk on payers, while capitation shifts risk to providers</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Payment timing**: Fee models pay after service; capitation pays prospectively</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Incentives**: Fee models may incentivize volume; capitation and bundled payments incentivize efficiency</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Coordination**: Bundled and global payments encourage better provider coordination</span>
