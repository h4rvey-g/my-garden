# Adverse events and medical errors
---
## Definitions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Medical error: an action or failure to act that exposes a patient to possible harm in the context of medical care, regardless of whether or not harm actually occurs</span>; focuses on the process (the misstep or omission).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Adverse event: an unintended harmful consequence of a medical treatment, which may or may not be the result of a medical error</span>; focuses on the outcome (actual harm done to the patient).
## Classification of medical errors
- **Active error**
    - Occurs at level of frontline operator (eg, wrong IV pump dose programmed)
    - Immediate impact
- **Latent error**
    - Occurs in processes indirect from operator but impacts patient care (eg, different types of IV pumps used within same hospital)
    - Accident waiting to happen
## Classification of adverse events
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Preventable adverse event**</span>
	- Any adverse event that is due to a medical error
	- A patient is given a medication to which they are allergic because their allergy information was never documented in the chart.
- **Ameliorable adverse event**	
	- An unpreventable adverse event that could have been reduced in severity through specific actions
	- A patient's correctly placed IV subsequently becomes infiltrated (unpreventable), but this is not discovered for a number of hours because of understaffing
- **Never event**
    - Adverse event that is identifiable, serious, and usually preventable (eg, scalpel retained in a surgical patient's abdomen)
    - Major error that should never occur
    - **Sentinel event**â€”a never event that leads to death, permanent harm, or severe temporary harm
	    - Their occurrence can reveal vulnerabilities in the healthcare system
- **Near miss**
    - Unplanned event that does not result in harm but has the potential to do so (eg, pharmacist recognizes a medication interaction and cancels the order)
    - Narrow prevention of harm that exposes dangers
# Management of medical errors
---
- Initial disclosure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acknowledge errors openly</span>
	- Do not hide errors or other relevant factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Express empathy & give apology as appropriate</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid blaming or denigrating other team members & providers</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allow adequate opportunity for patient questions</span>
- Follow-up steps
	- Remain engaged in the patient's care
	- Outline steps to prevent future occurrence
