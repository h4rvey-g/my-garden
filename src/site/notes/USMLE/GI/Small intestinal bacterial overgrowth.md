- SIBO is a pathologically excessive growth of bacteria in the small intestine.
- **Core Mechanism**: Excessive numbers of bacteria in the small intestine (<10^5 organisms/mL is normal), leading to fermentation of carbohydrates, [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]], and mucosal inflammation.
# Etiology
---
- **↓ Motility**: Conditions that cause stasis, allowing bacteria to proliferate. Includes [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]] (autonomic neuropathy), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/MSK/Systemic sclerosis\|scleroderma]]</span>, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and post-operative adhesions.
- **Anatomic Abnormalities**: Surgical blind loops (e.g., Billroth II, Roux-en-Y), small bowel [[USMLE/GI/Diverticulosis\|diverticula]], strictures (Crohn's disease), or ileocecal valve resection.
- **↓ Acid/Enzyme Secretion**: Achlorhydria (chronic [[USMLE/GI/Proton pump inhibitors\|PPI]] use), [[USMLE/GI/Atrophic gastritis\|atrophic gastritis]], or pancreatic insufficiency.

# Pathophysiology
---
- The following result from bacterial overgrowth. 
	- ↑ Deconjugation of the bile acids
	- ↑ Production of folate
	- ↓ absorption of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]], fat-soluble vitamins, zinc, and iron

# Clinical features
---
- Bloating, flatulence
- Chronic watery diarrhea
- Severe: [[USMLE/GI/Steatorrhea\|steatorrhea]], vitamin deficiencies
