## Approach 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line: nonpharmacological measures (e.g., high-fiber diet, increased fluid intake, and exercise)</span> and/or trial of bulk-forming laxatives 
- Second-line: step-wise pharmacotherapy with laxatives from other classes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Begin with an osmotic laxative. </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">If symptoms persist, add a short course of a stimulant laxative.</span>
## Laxatives
- Bulk-forming laxatives (fiber)
	- Mechanism
		- Bulk-forming laxatives are indigestible, not systemically absorbed.
		- Soluble fibers increase water absorption in the intestinal lumen → stretching of the bowel wall → stimulation of peristalsis
- Osmotic laxatives
	- Agents: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyethylene glycol (PEG)</span> and [[USMLE/GI/Hepatic encephalopathy\|lactulose]]
- Stimulant laxatives (secretory laxatives)
	- Agents: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bisacodyl</span> and sodium picosulfate
	- Mechanism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulation of epithelial cell secretion of electrolytes into the colonic lumen → ↑ Secretion of fluid into the colon (with bisacodyl, this secretory activity is nitric oxide-mediated)</span>
		- Myenteric neuronal depolarization → colon contractions (peristalsis)
- Surfactant (eg, docusate)
	- Decreases stool surface tension, enabling water to enter stool
- Chloride channel agonist (eg, lubiprostone)
	- Causes chloride efflux into intestinal lumen, which is followed by sodium and watered
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists (eg, methylnaltrexone)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Counteracts inhibitory effect of [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Opioids\|opioids]] on peristalsis</span>
