- Descriptions
	- NAFLD: non-alcohol related <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accumulation of fat in the liver cells</span>
	- NASH: NAFLD with chronic inflammation and damage of liver cells
- Epidemiology: very widespread
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obesity and/or type 2 [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]] (metabolic syndrome)</span>
		- Due to excess supply of nutrients in the liver
- Pathophysiology: ↑ Insulin resistance 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Hepatic uptake of fatty acids</span>
		- Essentially, insulin resistance creates a situation where fat storage in the designated areas (fat cells) is impaired, causing the liver to take on an excess burden of processing these fatty acids.
	- ↑ Triglyceride synthesis
	- ↑ Peripheral lipolysis
- Clinical features 
	- Often asymptomatic
	- [[USMLE/GI/Hepatomegaly\|Hepatomegaly]]
	- May progress to [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]] 
- Diagnostics
	- ↑ Transaminases (AST/ALT ratio < 1): The reversal of the AST/ALT ratio to values > 1 may indicate progression to [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]]. 
	- Rule out other causes of chronic hepatitis (e.g., heavy alcohol use, [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|hepatitis B]], [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis C\|hepatitis C]], [[USMLE/GI/Wilson disease\|Wilson disease]], autoimmune hepatitis, [[USMLE/Blood/Hemochromatosis\|hemochromatosis]], α1-antitrypsin deficiency)

>[!Mnemonic] 
>There is more A<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">L</span>T than AST (AST/ALT < 1) if the Liver is infiltrated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">L</span>ipids.

- Pathology
	- Hepatocellular lipid accumulation, mostly macrovesicular
