|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Congenital umbilical hernia** | Incomplete closure of umbilical ring (fascial opening) | Benign, reducible protrusion                               | Defect covered by skin; Midline (umbilical cord at apex) |
| **Omphalocele**         | Abnormal gut rotation without physiologic reduction back into abdominal cavity | Sac containing bowel Â± other abdominal organs              | Defect covered by peritoneum (no skin, fascia, muscle); Midline (umbilical cord at apex) |
| **Gastroschisis**       | Full-thickness abdominal wall defect           | Eviscerated bowel                                          | Not covered by membrane; Located to the right of midline/umbilicus |

>[!tip] 
>Unlike in cases of omphalocele, gastroschisis does not manifest with a hernia sac.

>[!Mnemonic] 
>Omphalocele keeps your gut O-sealed (covered with peritoneum), but in Gastroschisis, the Gut freezes (herniates through the abdominal wall without being covered by peritoneum).
