# Blood Supply of the Esophagus
---
**Arterial Supply (Segmental)**

- **Cervical (Upper 1/3):** **Inferior thyroid artery** (a branch of the thyrocervical trunk).
- **Thoracic (Middle 1/3):** **Esophageal branches** directly from the **thoracic aorta** and bronchial arteries.
- **Abdominal (Lower 1/3):** **Left gastric artery** (a branch of the celiac trunk) and left inferior phrenic artery.

**Venous Drainage (Segmental)**

- **Cervical (Upper 1/3):** **Inferior thyroid vein**, which drains into the brachiocephalic vein (systemic circulation).
- **Thoracic (Middle 1/3):** **Azygos and hemiazygos veins**, which drain into the superior vena cava (systemic circulation).
- **Abdominal (Lower 1/3):** **Left gastric vein**, which drains into the **portal vein** (portal circulation).

**Key Associations/Complications**

- **Esophageal Varices:** A critical **porto-caval (or porto-systemic) anastomosis** exists in the submucosa of the lower esophagus. The left gastric vein (portal system) anastomoses with the azygos vein (systemic system).
    - **Pathophysiology:** In **portal hypertension** (e.g., due to cirrhosis), blood shunts from the high-pressure portal system to the low-pressure systemic system. This causes the submucosal veins in the lower esophagus to become engorged and dilated, forming varices.
    - **Clinical Significance:** These varices are prone to rupture, leading to life-threatening upper GI hemorrhage (hematemesis). This is a major cause of mortality in patients with advanced liver disease.
