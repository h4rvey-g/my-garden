# Epidemiology
---
Frequency: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hepatic hemangioma (most common)</span> > focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) > hepatocellular adenoma (rare)

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatic hemangioma: possible hormonal component; [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|estrogen]] therapy associated with increased growth</span>

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contraindicated in hepatic hemangiomas, as it may cause bleeding</span>
