# Etiology
## Risk factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking, caffeine and alcohol consumption </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">All three substances decrease LES tone.</span> Alcohol and caffeine also stimulate gastric acid secretion, which, in combination with frequent TLESRs, increases the risk of esophageal mucosal injury from the gastric refluxate.
- Stress 
- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|Obesity]] 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]]</span> 
	- GERD is present in up to 80% of pregnancies. The underlying pathophysiology involves<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> increased abdominal pressure, decreased LES tone (due to high estrogen and progesterone levels during pregnancy), and prolonged gastric emptying as a result of reduced gastric motility.</span>
