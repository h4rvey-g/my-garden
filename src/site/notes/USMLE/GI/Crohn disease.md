# Epidemiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical age of onset: bimodal distribution with one peak at 15–35 years and another one at 55–70 years</span>
>[!tip] 
>Compared with [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|Ulcerative colitis]], which peaks at 15-35 y/o.
- Populations with higher prevalence
	- Individuals of Northern European descent
	- Individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent

# Etiology
- Risk factors
	- Familial aggregation
	- Genetic predisposition (e.g., mutation of the NOD2 gene, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-B27]] association</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tobacco smoke</span>

>[!tip] 
>- Nicotine consumption is the only (known) controllable risk factor for CD. Therefore, smoking cessation is especially important in patients with CD.
>- While smoking is a protective factor in [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|Ulcerative colitis]]

# Clinical features
## Constitutional symptoms
- Low-grade fever
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
## Gastrointestinal symptoms
CD most <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon</span>, but involvement of any part of the GI tract (from mouth to anus) is possible. In contrast to [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|ulcerative colitis]], <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rectal involvement is uncommon</span>. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic diarrhea, typically nonbloody, watery</span>
- Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (uncommon)
	- microscopic (i.e., identified only on stool analysis) or overt
- Abdominal pain, typically in the RLQ
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpable abdominal mass  in the RLQ  </span>
	- Due to adhesions within the intestine caused by inflammation![Pasted image 20231026105145.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231026105145.png)

		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Since [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|ulcerative colitis]] does not affect the small intestine, [[USMLE/GI/Absorption\|absorption]] of nutrients is not impaired.</span> However, loss of appetite, poor tolerance of or avoidance of certain foods, and adjustment of diet without medical consultation can lead to malnutrition already in nonsevere disease.
	- Enterocutaneous or perianal fistulas, often associated with abscess formation

>[!tip] 
>Anemia in CD may result from chronic disease, iron deficiency, and/or [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]] deficiency.

# Diagnostics
![Pasted image 20241009172413.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241009172413.png)
## Endoscopy
- Indication: all patients with suspected CD
	- Assesses the distribution and severity of the disease
	- Aids differentiation of CD from other diseases (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|ulcerative colitis]])
	- Monitors disease activity (e.g., active disease, remission)
	- Can be used therapeutically (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stricture dilatation</span>)
- Supportive findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skip lesions</span>: segmental and/or discontinuous pattern of involvement (interspersed with normal tissue)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Linear and/or serpiginous ulcerations </span>![Pasted image 20231026112109.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231026112109.png)
	- Small aphthous ulcerations 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cobblestone sign: inflamed edematous sections interspersed with deep ulcerations that resemble cobblestones</span> ![Pasted image 20231026112246.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231026112246.png)
	- Erythema, fissures, strictures, and fistulas
## Imaging
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cross-sectional enterography (MRE, CTE): preferred imaging modality for CD</span>
	- Edematous thickening of the intestinal wall 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Creeping fat: excessive mesenteric fat around the affected segments of bowel</span>
		- Possibly in response to intestinal bacteria translocation
## Laboratory studies
- To monitor disease activity
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fecal calprotectin and/or fecal lactoferrin</span>: proteins associated with neutrophil activation 
		- Used as noninvasive markers of intestinal inflammation to monitor disease activity and response to therapy
		- Also used to differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome
	- Inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR


# Treatment
---
## Principle
- Induction phase
	- Used to manage acute flares.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agents that have a rapid onset of action (e.g., corticosteroids, biologics) are used. </span>
- Maintenance phase
	- Used to maintain remission, typically in patients with moderate or severe CD and those at high risk of progression of CD.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Biologics and immunomodulators are the principal agents of maintenance therapy.</span>
## Pharmacotherapy
- Corticosteroids
	- Primarily used to induce remission
	- Agents used (depending on severity of CD):
		- Controlled ileal release budesonide
			- A formulation of the synthetic steroid budesonide that is released in environments with a pH ≥ 5.5, which facilitates drug delivery distal to the proximal small bowel
			- Used to treat Crohn disease that involves sites of inflammation in the ileum and/or ascending colon
	- Oral prednisolone
	- IV methylprednisolone
- Biologics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TNF-α antibodies</span>: e.g., adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab
		- Increasingly used as a primary agent to induce remission.
		- Also used to maintain remission and manage CD refractory to immunomodulators
	- Anti-leukocyte trafficking antibody (vedolizumab) and anti-p40 antibody (ustekinumab) : used mainly to induce and maintain remission in moderate to severe CD
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunomodulators: e.g., thiopurine analogs (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine), methotrexate</span>
	- Primarily used to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">maintain remission</span>
	- Can be used as a steroid-sparing regimen to induce remission 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">5-aminosalicylic acid derivative: sulfasalazine</span> (mesalamine is not routinely recommended) 
	- May be considered to induce remission of mild to moderate colonic or ileocolonic CD
	- Not effective in isolated small bowel disease
