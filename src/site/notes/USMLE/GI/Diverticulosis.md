# Definition
- Diverticula: blind pouches that protrude from the gastrointestinal wall and communicate with the lumen 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">True diverticulum</span>: a type of diverticulum that affects all layers of the intestinal wall.
		- Rare (except [[USMLE/Reproductive/Meckel diverticulum\|Meckel diverticulum]])
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically congenital</span>
		- Most commonly occur in the cecum
		- Occur less commonly in the colon
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">False diverticulum or pseudodiverticulum</span>: type of diverticulum that involves only the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mucosa and submucosa</span> and does not contain muscular layer or adventitia.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common type of gastrointestinal diverticula</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically acquired</span>, result from **increased intraluminal pressure** pushing the mucosa and submucosa through the muscularis propria. The muscular layer of the colon has natural <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weak points</span> where the **vasa recta** (nutrient arteries) penetrate from the serosa to the submucosa. These entry points provide a path of least resistance for herniation.![Pasted image 20250720111418.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250720111418.png)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Localized particularly in the sigmoid colon </span>
			- The sigmoid colon is the section of the colon with the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">smallest diameter</span>. Due to the narrow passage, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intraluminal pressure is highest</span> in the sigmoid colon, which promotes the formation of diverticula.
- Diverticulosis: the presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multiple colonic diverticula without evidence of infection</span>

>[!tip] False diverticulum vs false aneurysm
>- False diverticulum has continous mucosa and submucosa
>- False aneurysm has perforation of the whole vascular wall, bound by the tunica adventitia or only the surrounding tissue (pseudocapsule)![L2754.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L2754.jpg)

# Epidemiology
- In the US, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">∼ 50% of individuals > 60 years have diverticulosis</span>

---
# Etiology
- Caused mainly by lifestyle and environmental factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diet (low-fiber, rich in fat and red meat)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May lead to [[USMLE/GI/Constipation\|constipation]]</span>
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|Obesity]]
	- Low physical activity

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased intraluminal pressure</span>, e.g., due to chronic [[USMLE/GI/Constipation\|constipation]] 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weakness of the intestinal wall</span>
	- Age-related loss of elasticity of the connective tissue
	- Physiological gaps in the intestinal wall, which occur where blood vessels penetrate, predispose to protrusion and herniation of intestinal mucosa and submucosa.
