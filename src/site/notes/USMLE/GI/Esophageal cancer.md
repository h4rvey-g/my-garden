# Epidemiology
- Adenocarcinoma: most common type of esophageal cancer in the US (67%)
- Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): most common type of esophageal cancer worldwide (90%)

---
# Etiology
## Adenocarcinoma
- Exogenous risk factors
	- Smoking (twofold risk)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|Obesity]]</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increases intragastric pressure, frequency of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, and rates of [[USMLE/GI/Hiatal hernia\|hiatal hernia]], which promote [[USMLE/GI/Gastroesophageal reflux disease\|GERD]]</span>
- Endogenous risk factors
	- Male sex
	- Older age (50â€“60 years)
	- Gastroesophageal reflux
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Barrett esophagus</span>
- Localization: mostly in the lower third of the esophagus![Pasted image 20250312201906.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250312201906.png)
>[!tip] 
>The most important risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gastroesophageal reflux and associated Barrett esophagus.</span>

## Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
- Exogenous risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol consumption</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking (ninefold risk)</span>
	- Diet low in fruits and vegetables
	- Hot beverages
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nitrosamines exposure</span> (e.g., cured meat, fish, bacon)
- Endogenous risk factors
	- [[USMLE/GI/Plummer-Vinson syndrome\|Plummer-Vinson syndrome]]
	- [[USMLE/GI/Achalasia\|Achalasia]]
 - Localization: mostly in the upper two-thirds of the esophagus
>[!tip] 
>The primary risk factors for squamous cell esophageal cancer are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">alcohol consumption, smoking, and dietary factors (e.g., diet low in fruits and vegetables).</span>
