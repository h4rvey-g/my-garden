# Subtypes and variants
## Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency
- See [[USMLE/GI/Steatorrhea\|Steatorrhea]]
## Short bowel syndrome
- Definition: a condition in which the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small bowel cannot adequately absorb</span> nutrients, water, or electrolytes
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Small bowel resection, e.g., in [[USMLE/GI/Crohn disease\|Crohn disease]], trauma</span>
	- Congenital visceral malformations
- Management
	- Diet optimization
	- Total parenteral nutrition in patients with intestinal failure

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
- Evaluation for [[USMLE/GI/Steatorrhea\|steatorrhea]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fats are typically the earliest and most severely affected nutrient in generalized malabsorption, and testing for fat malabsorption is therefore the most sensitive strategy for screening for malabsorptive disorders.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudan III stain</span>
	- 72-hour fecal fat test
- Blood tests: macrocytic and/or microcytic anemia; ↓ electrolytes, ↓ total protein, vitamin deficiencies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">D-xylose absorption test: assesses the absorptive function of the upper small intestine</span>
	- Because absorption of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">D-xylose in the intestine does not rely on the breakdown by pancreatic enzymes</span>, a normal increase in urinary D-xylose excretion indicates a healthy intestinal mucosa. In conditions associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, oral administration of D-xylose will result in increased fecal D-xylose excretion.
	- Polysaccharides need to be degraded by amylase before absorption. However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">monosaccharides (eg, glucose, [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Galactose metabolism\|galactose]], D-xylose) are taken up directly</span> by the epithelial cells of the small intestine through either sodium-dependent cotransport or facilitated diffusion.
- Hydrogen breath test: assess the intestinal absorption of individual carbohydrates
- Further testing (for underlying diseases): e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Celiac disease\|celiac disease]] or [[USMLE/GI/Lactose intolerance\|lactose intolerance]]
