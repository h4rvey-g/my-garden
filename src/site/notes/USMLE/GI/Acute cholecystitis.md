## Acute acalculous cholecystitis
- Description: an acute <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">life-threatening</span> necroinflammatory disorder of the gallbladder, usually seen <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in critically ill patients, that is not associated with [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|gallstones]]</span>
- Etiology: conditions predisposing to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bile stasis and reduced perfusion</span> of the gallbladder
	- Risk factors 
		- Multiorgan failure (critically ill patients)
		- Severe trauma, [[USMLE/MSK/Burns\|burns]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Surgery</span>
		- Infection (e.g., CMV)
		- Sepsis, septic shock
		- Total parenteral nutrition
		- Prolonged [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use\|fasting]]
- Clinical features: similar to acute calculous cholecystitis

## Chronic cholecystitis
- Clinical features: recurrent symptoms similar to acute cholecystitis but typically less severe and often self-limiting
- Complications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Porcelain gallbladder</span>
		- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">calcification of the gallbladder wall due to chronic inflammation</span>
		- Imaging (x-ray or noncontrast CT abdomen): focal or diffuse <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperdensity</span> (radiopaque appearance) of the gallbladder wall![highresdefault_L406.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L406.jpg)
		- Clinical significance: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a risk factor for gallbladder cancer </span>
		- Treatment: conservative management or laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on symptoms, pattern of gallbladder calcification, and comorbidities
