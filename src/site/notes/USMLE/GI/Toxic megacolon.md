# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Bacterial: [[USMLE/Infective disease/Clostridium difficile infection\|C. difficile]] (pseudomembranous colitis), Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter infections
- Inflammatory colitis: [[USMLE/GI/Ulcerative colitis\|Ulcerative colitis]], [[USMLE/GI/Crohn disease\|Crohn disease]]

---
# Pathophysiology
- Colonic accumulation of inflammatory mediators and bacteria → nitric oxide synthesis → colonic dilation
- Edema and inflammation of the colonic smooth muscle → colonic dysmotility → colonic dilation

---
# Clinical features
- (Bloody) [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]] and vomiting
- Abdominal distention and pain
- Signs of [[USMLE/Infective disease/Sepsis\|sepsis]] (fever, tachycardia, hypotension) and dehydration

---
# Diagnostics
- Abdominal x-ray findings 
	- Dilation of the colon (transverse colon diameter > 6 cm)
	- Loss of haustration 
	- Multiple air-fluid levels![Pasted image 20230919160024.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230919160024.png)

>[!warning] 
>Colonoscopy should be avoided in patients with suspected toxic megacolon since it increases the risk of colonic perforation.
