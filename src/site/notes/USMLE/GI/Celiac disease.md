# Etiology
- Genetic predisposition with association to HLA antigens
	- [[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-DQ2]] in 90–95% of patients
	- [[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-DQ8]] in 5–10% of patients
- Consuming gliadin from grains such as wheat, rye, and barley leads to an autoimmune reaction within the small intestinal wall.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Symptoms manifest when a genetically predisposed individual develops an immunological response to gliadin, an alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten.
- Consumption of food containing gluten → tissue transglutaminase is released  → modifies gliadin from gluten proteins → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pathogenic T cells</span> react to and are activated by modified gliadin → mediate chronic intestinal inflammation → epithelial damage resulting in villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and loss of brush border → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired resorption of nutrients in the small intestine (especially in the distal duodenum and proximal jejunum) → [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]] symptoms</span>![Pasted image 20231028095408.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231028095408.png)

# Clinical features
## Gastrointestinal symptoms
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic or recurring [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]]: [[USMLE/GI/Steatorrhea\|steatorrhea]]</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flatulence, abdominal bloating, and pain</span>
## Extraintestinal symptoms and associations
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**[[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|Malabsorption]] symptoms**: fatigue, weight loss, vitamin deficiency, [[USMLE/Blood/Iron deficiency anemia\|iron deficiency anemia]], [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]], [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypocalcemia\|hypocalcemia]]</span>
- In children: failure to thrive, growth failure, delayed puberty, secondary [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism\|hyperparathyroidism]]
- Dermatologic associations: **[[USMLE/MSK/Dermatitis herpetiformis\|dermatitis herpetiformis]]**
	- Transglutaminases play a role in forming extensively cross-linked proteins (e.g., elastin, coagulation by factor XIII).
- Neuropsychiatric symptoms: peripheral neuropathies (numbness, burning and tingling of the hands and feet) , headache, ataxia, depression, irritability
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Commonly associated with autoimmune diseases</span>


# Diagnostics
---
## Laboratory studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG IgA): initial test</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Total IgA</span>
	- Indicated for all patients because of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high prevalence of [[USMLE/Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency\|IgA deficiency]] in patients with celiac disease</span> (approx. 2–3%)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Both celiac disease and selective IgA deficiency have strong associations with specific HLA</span> genes, particularly HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8.
	- If patients have low IgA, perform further IgG-based testing.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deamidated gliadin peptide</span>
	- IgG-based testing: indicated in [[USMLE/Immunology/Selective IgA deficiency\|IgA deficiency]] or discordant biopsy and serology
		- IgG-tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgG)
		- IgG deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgG)
	- IgA-based testing: IgA deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP IgA)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-endomysial antibody (EMA): Potential second-line confirmatory test (high-specificity)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Celiac disease is not associated with elevated systemic inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), since it's limited.</span>
## Endoscopy
- EGD with small intestine biopsy (confirmatory test)
	- Intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltration
	- Crypt hyperplasia
	- Villous atrophy![highresdefault_L65170.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L65170.jpg)
# Differential diagnostics
---
## Tropical sprue
- Definition: A disease characterized by chronic diarrhea with subsequent malabsorption in association with a stay in the tropics or subtropics.
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">occurs in residents of the tropics and subtropics or in travelers returning from these areas (after trips lasting several weeks)</span>
- Etiology: exact cause not known; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most likely due to bacterial infection that leads to structural damage of the intestinal mucosa </span>
- Clinical features: similar to Celiac disease
- Diagnostics
	- Endoscopy of the small bowel and biopsy: villous atrophy, elongated crypts, presence of inflammatory cells (plasma cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils)
- Treatment: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tetracycline</span> in combination with folic acid for 3–6 months
# Treatment
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strict, lifelong gluten-free diet </span>
	- Abstain from products containing wheat, rye, barley, or spelt.
	- Symptoms usually improve quickly
