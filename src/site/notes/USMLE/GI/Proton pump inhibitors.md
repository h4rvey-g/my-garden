# Adverse effects

- Gastrointestinal
	- ↑ Risk of C. difficile infection 
	- ↓ Absorption of iron and vitamin B12
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Absorption of calcium and magnesium → ↑ risk of osteoporosis in long-term use→ ↑ risk of fractures in elderly individuals</span>
		- Because the gastric environment becomes less acidic, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dietary calcium remains bound to oxalate, resulting in reduced absorption in the duodenum and jejunum.</span>
	- The resultant increase in gastric pH leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased gastrin formation</span>, which, over time, can lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypertrophy of ECL and parietal cells</span>.  After chronic use (eg, >8 weeks), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abrupt cessation of the PPI can trigger rebound gastric acid hypersecretion by the hyperfunctioning parietal cells, leading to reflux symptoms; PPIs can be slowly tapered to prevent this adverse effect.</span>
