# Pathophysiology/Etiology
*   **Definition:** Malignant neoplasm of the oropharynx, which includes the tonsils, base of the tongue, soft palate, and pharyngeal walls. Over 90% are **squamous cell carcinomas (SCC)**.
*   **Two distinct etiologies:**
    *   **HPV-Associated (70-80% of cases in North America/Europe):** Primarily caused by **HPV-16**. The E6 oncoprotein inactivates p53, and the E7 oncoprotein inactivates Rb (retinoblastoma protein), leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Typically affects a younger demographic (4th-5th decade) and is associated with sexual behavior.
    *   **Non-HPV-Associated:** Strongly linked to traditional risk factors like **tobacco** (smoking and smokeless) and **alcohol** use, especially in combination (synergistic effect). Tends to occur in an older population (6th-7th decade).
*   **Field Cancerization:** Widespread exposure of the upper aerodigestive tract to carcinogens (like tobacco) can lead to multiple independent primary tumors or a higher risk of recurrence.

# Clinical Presentation
*   **Often asymptomatic in early stages**, leading to late diagnosis.
*   **Most common presenting symptom:** A persistent, painless **neck mass** (cervical lymphadenopathy), which is often cystic.
*   **Local Symptoms:**
    *   Persistent sore throat.
    *   **Odynophagia** (painful swallowing) and/or **dysphagia** (difficulty swallowing).
    *   **Referred otalgia** (ear pain) via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX).
    *   Trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), muffled voice ("hot potato voice"), or dysarthria.
    *   Unintentional weight loss.
*   **Physical Exam:** May reveal an ulcerative, indurated, or exophytic lesion, or a red/white patch (erythroplakia/leukoplakia) in the oropharynx.

# Diagnosis
*   **Initial Evaluation:** Laryngoscopy and a thorough head and neck exam to visualize the primary tumor.
*   **Gold Standard:** **Biopsy** of the primary lesion for histopathologic confirmation.![Pasted image 20250721205707.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250721205707.png)
*   **HPV Testing:** All newly diagnosed oropharyngeal SCCs should be tested for HPV, typically via **p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC)**, which serves as a surrogate marker. This is crucial as HPV status is a major prognostic factor and determines the staging system used.
*   **Staging:**
    *   **CT with contrast** of the neck and chest is the initial imaging modality to assess tumor extent and nodal/distant metastases.
    *   **PET/CT** is superior for detecting regional and distant metastases.

# DDx 
*   **Infectious:** Tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess (fever, acute onset), oral candidiasis, oral tuberculosis, syphilis.
*   **Benign Lesions:** Leukoplakia, erythroplakia (premalignant), oral lichen planus.
*   **Other Malignancies:** Lymphoma (may present with nodal disease), metastatic disease from another primary site.

# Management/Treatment
*   Treatment is complex and multidisciplinary, depending on the stage and HPV status.
*   **Early-Stage (I-II):** Single modality therapy, either **surgery** (e.g., transoral robotic surgery - TORS) or **radiation therapy (RT)**.
*   **Advanced-Stage (III-IV):** Multimodality therapy is standard.
    *   **Primary Treatment:** Concurrent **chemoradiation** (chemotherapy, often cisplatin-based, given with RT) is the most common approach.
    *   Surgery may be used first, followed by adjuvant RT or chemoradiation, depending on risk factors.
*   **Targeted Therapy/Immunotherapy:** Agents like Cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) or checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., Nivolumab) are options for recurrent or metastatic disease.

# Key Associations/Complications
*   **Prognosis:** HPV-positive tumors have a **significantly better prognosis** and response to treatment compared to HPV-negative tumors. The 5-year survival is >80% for HPV-positive vs. <50% for HPV-negative cancers.
*   **Complications of Treatment:** Significant long-term morbidity from radiation includes xerostomia (dry mouth), mucositis, odynophagia (requiring feeding tube), and risk of osteoradionecrosis.
*   **Second Primary Malignancy:** Patients with HNSCC, especially those with tobacco/alcohol-related cancers, are at high risk for developing another primary tumor in the aerodigestive tract (e.g., lung, esophagus) due to field cancerization.
