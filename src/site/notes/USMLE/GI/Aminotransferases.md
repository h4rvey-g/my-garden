-   **Pathophysiology/Etiology**
    *   Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are enzymes concentrated in hepatocytes.
    *   Hepatocellular injury (inflammation/necrosis) causes their release into the bloodstream, making them key markers of liver damage.
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**ALT (Alanine aminotransferase)** is more specific for the liver.</span>
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**AST (Aspartate aminotransferase)** is also found in cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, kidney, and brain.</span>

-   **Clinical Interpretation & DDx**
    *   The **pattern and magnitude** of elevation and the **AST/ALT ratio** are crucial for differential diagnosis.
    *   **Degree of Elevation:**
        *   **Mild Elevation (<5x ULN):** Very common. Causes include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis (B or C), medications, and hemochromatosis.
        *   **Marked Elevation (>1000 IU/L):** Differential is narrow. Think:
            1.  **Ischemic hepatitis** ("shock liver"): Often with very high LDH and rapid fall in AST/ALT.
            2.  **Acute viral hepatitis** (A or B, not typically C).
            3.  **Toxin/Drug-induced liver injury** (especially **acetaminophen**).
            4.  Less common: Autoimmune hepatitis exacerbation, Budd-Chiari syndrome, Wilson's disease.

-   **AST/ALT Ratio (De Ritis Ratio)**
    *   **AST/ALT > 2:1:**
        *   Classic finding in **alcoholic liver disease**.
        *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanism: Alcohol causes mitochondrial injury (rich in AST) and pyridoxal phosphate (Vitamin B6) deficiency, which is a necessary cofactor for ALT synthesis.</span>
        *   An elevated GGT further supports alcohol-related damage.
    *   **AST/ALT < 1:**
        *   Most other causes of liver injury, including **viral hepatitis** and **NAFLD**.
    *   **AST/ALT > 1 (but < 2):**
        *   Can be seen in progression to **cirrhosis** from various causes (e.g., NAFLD, viral hepatitis).

-   **Differential Diagnosis Summary**

| Condition                  | Typical Transaminase Pattern             | Key Features                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Alcoholic Liver Disease**  | **AST/ALT > 2:1**, AST usually <500 IU/L | Macrocytosis, ↑ GGT, history of heavy alcohol use.                 |
| **NAFLD/NASH**             | **ALT > AST** (Ratio < 1), mild elevation  | Associated with metabolic syndrome (obesity, T2DM, dyslipidemia).     |
| **Acute Viral Hepatitis**    | **ALT >> AST** (both often >1000 IU/L)   | Jaundice, fever, RUQ pain; positive viral serologies.                   |
| **Ischemic Hepatitis**       | Massive ↑ AST & ALT (>1000s), rapid fall | Setting of shock/hypotension; markedly ↑ LDH.                         |
| **Toxin/Drug Injury**        | Massive ↑ AST & ALT (>1000s)             | History of exposure (e.g., acetaminophen overdose, isoniazid, statins). |
| **Chronic Viral Hepatitis**  | Mild elevation, often ALT > AST          | Often asymptomatic; AST/ALT ratio can increase with fibrosis.      |
| **Autoimmune Hepatitis**     | ↑ ALT & AST, ↑ total protein/globulin    | (+) ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA).                             |
| **Hemochromatosis**        | Mild ↑ ALT & AST, ↑ Ferritin, ↑ Iron sat | "Bronze diabetes," arthropathy, cardiomyopathy.                         |
| **Wilson's Disease**         | ↑ Transaminases, ↓ Ceruloplasmin         | Neurologic/psychiatric symptoms, Kayser-Fleischer rings.                 |

-   **Extrahepatic Causes of Elevated Transaminases**
    *   **Muscle Injury:** Rhabdomyolysis, vigorous exercise, polymyositis. Results in ↑ AST > ↑ ALT.
    *   **Hemolysis:** Can cause a mild rise in AST.
    *   **Other:** Celiac disease, thyroid disorders.
