# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Parenteral
	- Needle sharing among individuals who use injection drugs 
	- Needlestick injury (e.g., health care workers)
	- Blood [[USMLE/Blood/Transfusion\|transfusion]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dialysis</span>
- Organ transplantation
- Sexual: rare (in contrast to [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|HBV]] and [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]])

# Pathophysiology
## Pathogen
- The risk of chronic infection is multifactorial and depends on the host's ability to clear the pathogen through activation of multiple innate immunity pathways against the viral envelope. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flawed proofreading capability of RNA-dependent [[USMLE/Biochemistry/RNA polymerases\|RNA polymerase]] (no 3′– 5′ exonuclease activity) introduces mutations into genes encoding viral glycoprotein envelope and enabling novel antigen production.</span>
	- Rapid replication rate produces many antigenically unique viral envelopes.
	- Infection persists because the production rate of new mutant virions exceeds the production rate of host antibodies.

# Clinical features
>[!Mnemonic] 
>H<font color="#ffc000">A</font>V only has <font color="#ffc000">a</font>cute phase, H<font color="#ffc000">C</font>V mostly has <font color="#ffc000">c</font>hronic phase (and is <font color="#ffc000">c</font>urable)

## Incubation period
- 2 weeks to 6 months
## Acute course (< 6 months)
- Asymptomatic in 80% of cases
## Chronic course (> 6 months)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seen especially in asymptomatic individuals (up to 85%), as the disease may go undiagnosed and treatment may be delayed or never initiated (carrier state).</span>
- Findings often mild, nonspecific (e.g., fatigue)
- Liver [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]] (up to 25% of cases) within 20 years of infection
- Extrahepatic features of HCV (common) 
	- Hematological
		- Mixed cryoglobulinemia
		- Lymphoma (especially B-cell [[USMLE/Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas\|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]])
		- [[USMLE/Blood/Immune thrombocytopenia\|ITP]]
		- [[USMLE/Blood/Autoimmune hemolytic anemia\|Autoimmune hemolytic anemia]]
		- Monoclonal gammopathies
	- Renal
		- [[USMLE/Renal/Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\|Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] (more common)
		- Membranous glomerulonephritis
	- Dermatological
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Porphyria cutanea tarda</span>
		- [[USMLE/MSK/Oral white lesions\|Lichen planus]]
	- Endocrine
		- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]]
		- Autoimmune thyroiditis (may lead to [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]])
	- Vascular: leukocytoclastic [[USMLE/MSK/Vasculitides\|vasculitis]]

# Diagnostics
## Pathology
- Acute Phase 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Focal areas of macrovesicular steatosis</span>
	- Bile duct injury
	- Sinusoidal inflammation of hepatic cells
	- Lobular involvement in the form of eosinophilic single-cell necrosis
- Chronic phase
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lymphoid follicles in portal triad</span>
	- Necroinflammation of periportal liver cells
	- Variable degree of fibrosis
	- Severe hepatocyte injury
- Without treatment, the disease will ultimately progress to liver fibrosis, [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]], and [[USMLE/GI/Hepatocellular carcinoma\|hepatocellular carcinoma]].

# Treatment
## [[USMLE/Infective disease/Antiviral therapy\|Antiviral therapy]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)</span>
	- DAAs target specific enzymes in the HCV life cycle to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibit viral replication and assembly</span>
	- Example regimens
		- Glecaprevir PLUS pibrentasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Sofosbuvir PLUS velpatasvir (all 6 genotypes)
		- Ledipasvir PLUS sofosbuvir (genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6)
- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor\|Interferon]] PLUS ribavirin
	- Was the preferred treatment before the development of DAAs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with severe adverse effects</span> (e.g., arthralgias, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, depression, anemia) and teratogenicity
	- Contraindicated in patients with decompensated [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]] (high risk of worsening [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]] decompensation)
	- Ribavirin
		- Mechanism of action
			- Guanosine analogue (nucleoside inhibitor)
			- Competitive inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of guanine nucleosides synthesis</span>
		- Adverse effects
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Blood/Hemolytic anemia\|Hemolytic anemia]]</span>
			- Highly [[USMLE/Reproductive/Teratogenesis\|teratogenic]]

>[!tip] 
>DAAs have superior efficacy and safety profiles compared with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor\|interferon]] or ribavirin-based regimens and are thus preferred.
