# Treatment
---
## Pharmacotherapy
### First-line options
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Naltrexone and acamprosate are preferred. </span>
	- Naltrexone: central μ-opioid receptor antagonist
	- Acamprosate: may modulate central glutamate receptors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Both medications reduce cravings</span> and can be used for patients who: 
	- Continue to drink alcohol
	- Use other substances recreationally 
### Alternative options
- Disulfiram
- Topiramate
- Gabapentin

# Complications
---
## Multisystem complications
- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|Cytochrome P450]] induction
- Vitamin deficiency
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B1\|Vitamin B1]] deficiency (thiamine deficiency): [[USMLE/Neurology/Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome\|Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome]]
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B6\|Vitamin B6]] deficiency: peripheral neuropathy 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vitamin B9 deficiency ([[USMLE/Biochemistry/Folate deficiency\|folate deficiency]]): megaloblastic anemia</span>
		- Depletion would take place over <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weeks</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|Vitamin B12]] deficiency: [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|subacute combined degeneration]] of [[USMLE/Neurology/Neuroloy physioloy\|spinal cord]] (funicular myelosis), megaloblastic [[USMLE/Blood/Anemia\|anemia]]</span>
		- Depletion would take place over <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">years</span>
- Electrolyte abnormalities: [[USMLE/Neurology/Hyponatremia\|Hyponatremia]], [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypokalemia\|Hypokalemia]], [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypocalcemia\|Hypocalcemia]]
	- Often caused by complications such as malnutrition, vomiting, or [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]]

# Alcohol intoxication
---
## Pathophysiology
- Mechanism 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|GABA]]-A receptor agonist → Chronic use causes downregulation of GABA-A receptors → decreased GABA-A activity when cessation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">NMDA glutamate antagonist → chronic use causes upregulation of NMDA receptors → increased glutamate NMDA activity when cessation</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absorption: The majority of alcohol consumed is absorbed by the proximal small intestine</span>; only a small amount of alcohol is absorbed by the oral, esophageal, and/or gastric mucosa.
## Clinical features
Altered consciousness, cognition, perception, judgment, affect, and/or behavior.
## Diagnostics
- Routine laboratory studies that support the diagnosis include:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated osmolar gap</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The difference between the measured serum osmolarity and the calculated serum osmolarity.</span> Normally, the calculated serum osmolarity is primarily determined by circulating levels of sodium salts (chloride and bicarbonate), glucose, and urea. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An increased serum osmolar gap occurs when other solutes (e.g., ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol) are present</span> in high enough concentrations to increase the measured osmolarity by more than 10 mOsmol/L.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anion gap metabolic acidosis</span> (e.g., ↓ pH, ↓ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>)
## Treatment
### Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors
- Goal: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">to prevent the conversion of methanol or ethylene glycol to toxic metabolites</span> (e.g., formic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid) by competitively inhibiting alcohol dehydrogenase
- Options
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fomepizole</span> (first-line): a competitive alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor; safer and easier to administer than ethanol
	- Ethanol (second-line)
