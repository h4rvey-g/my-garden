# Etiology
## Cholesterol stones (∼ 80% of cases)
- Radiolucent with radiopaque areas due to calcifications (< 20%)
- Composed of cholesterol and calcium carbonate
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Obesity</span>, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Female sex</span>
		- Especially during reproductive years due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased levels of estrogen and progesterone</span>
		- Increased estrogen levels cause increased secretion of bile rich in cholesterol, (lithogenic bile), which can result in the formation of cholesterol gallstones.
		- Increased progesterone levels cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased gallbladder contraction, and subsequent bile stasis with formation of gallstones.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiparity or pregnancy</span>
	- Age (> 40 years of age)
	- European, Native American, or Hispanic ancestry
	- Family history
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Drugs: fibrates (inhibition of cholesterol 7-α hydroxylase), estrogen therapy, oral contraceptives</span>
	- Malabsorption (e.g., Crohn disease, ileal resection, cystic fibrosis) 
	- Rapid weight loss (e.g., after bariatric surgery)
## Black pigment stones
- Radiopaque
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Composed of calcium bilirubinate</span>
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic hemolytic anemias (e.g., sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis)</span>
	- (Alcoholic) cirrhosis
	- Crohn disease
	- Total parenteral nutrition
	- Advanced age
- Pathophysiology: ↑ hemolysis → increase in circulating unconjugated bilirubin → increased uptake and conjugation of bilirubin → precipitation of bilirubin polymers and stone formation
## Mixed/brown pigment stones
- Radiolucent
- Risk factors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bacterial infections</span> and parasites (e.g., Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis species) in the biliary tract, sclerosing cholangitis
- Pathophysiology: infection or infestation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) → hydrolyzes conjugated bilirubin and lecithin in the bile → increased unconjugated bilirubin and fatty acids</span> → precipitation of calcium carbonate, cholesterol, and calcium bilirubinate (dark color) in bile
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unconjugated bilirubin is lipid-soluble and insoluble in water.</span> This insolubility allows it to precipitate with calcium ions, forming calcium bilirubinate. While conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble (bound to glucuronic acid) and remains dissolved in bile, preventing precipitation.
	- β-glucuronidase: a lysosomal enzyme that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deconjugates direct bilirubin</span>. Present in breast milk and can cause neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Also found in intestinal brush border cells, where it deconjugates direct bilirubin to release indirect bilirubin that is then reabsorbed and recycled. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bacterial β-glucuronidase in the biliary tract is implicated in the pathogenesis of brown pigment gallstones.</span>

## Nonoperative management of cholelithiasis
### Indications
- Patients at high risk of complications due to surgery or anesthesia (e.g., recent myocardial infarction)
- Patients unwilling to undergo surgery
### Oral bile acid dissolution therapy 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May be useful in dissolving pure cholesterol stones (i.e., radiolucent stones) that are &lt 0.5 cm </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ursodeoxycholic acid</span>
- Duration of therapy: 6–24 months [17][33]
### Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
