- [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|Gallstone]] ileus: mechanical bowel obstruction due to obstructive [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|gallstones]]
	- Pathophysiology: gallbladder perforation or [[USMLE/GI/Mirizzi syndrome\|Mirizzi syndrome]] → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">biliary-enteric fistula formation</span> (most commonly cholecystoenteric fistula) between the inflamed gallbladder and bowel → [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|gallstones]] passing down into bowel lumen![Pasted image 20231210113528.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231210113528.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sites of obstruction: terminal ileum, at ileocecal valve (most common)</span>
	- Symptoms: distal bowel obstruction: features of mechanical bowel obstruction (abdominal pain and distention, nausea, vomiting)
	- Diagnosis is based on the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rigler triad: imaging findings of small bowel obstruction, [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|gallstone]] (most commonly in iliac fossa), and pneumobilia</span>.
		- Air can move up toward the biliary ducts through a cholecystoenteric fistula.![Pasted image 20231210113752.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231210113752.png)![Pasted image 20231210113759.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231210113759.png)
