Minor mucosal trauma to an abnormal submucosal artery (usually located in the proximal stomach) leads to major bleeding (acute upper GI bleeding)
- It can be hard to visualize a Dieulafoy lesion on endoscopy because it is missing an ulcer base.
- Treatment includes endoscopic hemostasis (injection therapy, hemoclips, etc.) or excision of the susceptible mucosa
