# Colon ischemia (Ischemic colitis)
- **Pathophysiology/Etiology**
    - **Reduced blood flow** to the colon, leading to inflammation and injury. Most cases are due to **non-occlusive ischemia** (e.g., "low-flow" state like shock, heart failure, sepsis) rather than acute arterial occlusion.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Watershed areas** are most vulnerable due to limited collateral blood supply.</span>
        - **Splenic flexure** (Griffith's point): junction of SMA and IMA territories.
        - **Rectosigmoid junction** (Sudeck's point): junction of IMA and iliac artery territories.![Pasted image 20250716202443.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250716202443.png)
    - Risk factors: elderly age (>60), atherosclerosis, hypotension, heart failure, aortic surgery (esp. AAA repair with IMA ligation), vasculitis, hypercoagulable states.

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Classic triad: **rapid onset of mild-to-moderate crampy abdominal pain** (often left-sided), followed by **hematochezia** (bright red blood per rectum) or bloody diarrhea within 24 hours.</span>
    - Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur.
    - Peritoneal signs (rigidity, guarding) suggest transmural necrosis and perforation (a surgical emergency).

- **Diagnosis**
    - **CT scan with IV contrast** is the best initial imaging test to rule out other causes of abdominal pain and support the diagnosis.
        - Findings: **segmental bowel wall thickening ("thumbprinting")**, submucosal edema, and pericolonic fat stranding.
        - Severe findings: pneumatosis (gas in the bowel wall) or portal venous gas indicate infarction.
    - **Colonoscopy** is the gold standard for diagnosis, showing edematous, friable mucosa, petechial hemorrhages, and segmental erythema. It should be performed without aggressive insufflation to avoid perforation.
    - Labs are nonspecific but may show **leukocytosis** and elevated lactate in severe cases.

- **DDx (Differential Diagnosis)**
    - **Infectious colitis** (e.g., *C. difficile*, *E. coli* O157:H7, *Campylobacter*): Differentiated by stool cultures and specific toxin assays. Often has more profuse watery diarrhea and fever.
    - **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)** (Ulcerative Colitis/Crohn's): Onset is typically more gradual and chronic. Biopsy is key. UC pain is often LLQ, while Crohn's is often RLQ.
    - **Diverticulitis**: Presents with LLQ pain and fever but usually without significant bleeding.
    - **Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI)**: Much more severe "pain out of proportion to exam," often caused by an embolism to the SMA. Involves the small bowel. Requires angiography for diagnosis.

- **Management/Treatment**
    - Most cases are transient and resolve with supportive care.
    - **Bowel rest** (NPO), **IV fluids** to restore perfusion, and correction of underlying causes.
    - **Broad-spectrum antibiotics** (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole) are given to prevent bacterial translocation and sepsis.
    - **Surgical intervention** (colectomy) is required for patients with signs of peritonitis, bowel gangrene, or perforation.

- **Key Associations/Complications**
    - **Complications**: Gangrene, perforation, hemorrhage, and post-ischemic stricture formation.
    - **Prognosis**: Most patients recover fully with medical management. However, mortality is high if surgery is needed. Isolated right-sided colonic ischemia has a worse prognosis.
