- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactulose</span>: a synthetic disaccharide laxative
	- Indication: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">first-line</span> for treatment of hepatic encephalopathy
	- Mechanism: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactulose is converted to lactic acid by intestinal flora → acidification in the gut → conversion of ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+) → ammonium is excreted in the feces</span> → decreased blood ammonia concentration → decreased absorption of ammonia in the bowel → improved symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rifaximin</span>: a broad-spectrum, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nonabsorbable oral antibiotic </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduces the number of ammonia-producing intestinal bacteria</span>
	- May be added to lactulose if a second episode occurs to prevent recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy
