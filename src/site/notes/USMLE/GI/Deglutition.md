- Deglutition (swallowing) is the transfer of a bolus of food from the mouth down the pharynx and esophagus to the stomach.
- Encompasses the oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases
	- **Oral Phase (Deglutition)**
	    
	    - Voluntary process.
	    - The bolus of food is masticated (chewed), moistened in saliva, and propelled towards the oropharynx by the tongue (primarily via the palatoglossus and styloglossus muscles).
	- **Pharyngeal Phase (Deglutition)**
	    
	    - Involuntary process.
	    - Once the bolus of food is propelled backward, the<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> levator veli palatini and tensor veli palatini muscles</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">elevate the soft palate</span>, preventing food from entering the nasopharynx.
	    - The walls of the pharynx are elevated by the contraction of longitudinal pharyngeal muscles:
	        - Salpingopharyngeus
	        - Palatopharyngeus
	        - Stylopharyngeus
	    - The suprahyoid muscle contracts, elevating the hyoid bone and the larynx.
	    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The epiglottis closes</span>.
	        - Protect the opening of the larynx
	        - Prevents the passage of food into the trachea and respiratory tract(prevent aspiration).
	    - Can be affected by a stroke of the brainstem.
	- **Esophageal Phase (Deglutition)**
	    
	    - Involuntary process.
	    - Contraction of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (superior, middle, and inferior) propels the bolus of food downward to the esophagus.
	    - Esophageal peristalsis propels food towards the stomach.
	    - Affected by achalasia.

>[!tip] Airway-protective movements
>- Displacement of the larynx superiorly and anteriorly under the base of tongue, which allows food to be directed into the more posteriorly located esophagus
>- Tilting of the epiglottis to block the airway
>- Closing of the glottis by adduction of the vocal folds
