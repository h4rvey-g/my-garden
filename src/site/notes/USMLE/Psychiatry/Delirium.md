# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Risk factors
- Advanced age
- Neurologic disorder (e.g. [[USMLE/Neurology/Dementia\|dementia]], stroke)
- Sensory impairment (e.g. [[USMLE/Neurology/Hearing loss\|hearing loss]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sleep disruption</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immobilization</span>
## Precipitating causes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Drugs (eg, narcotics, sedatives, [[USMLE/Immunology/Antihistamines\|antihistamines]], muscle relaxers, polypharmacy)</span>
- Infections (eg, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]], urinary tract infection, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]])
- Electrolyte disturbances (eg, hyponatremia, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypercalcemia\|hypercalcemia]])
- Metabolic derangements (eg, volume depletion, [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12 deficiency]], hyperglycemia)
- Systemic illnesses (eg, [[congestive heart failure\|congestive heart failure]], hepatic failure, malignancy)
- CNS conditions (eg, seizure, stroke, head injury, subdural hematoma)


# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---


# Diagnostics
---
- Differential diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mania: cognition is intact; not disoriented; treated with lithium</span>

# Treatment
---
- Polypharmacy/psychoactive drug avoidance
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sleep facilitation: bright day/dim night lighting</span>
- Visual/hearing aids
- Mobilization: out of bed, restraint avoidance
## Treatment of agitation in delirium
- Agitation should initially be managed with nonpharmacologic strategies.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid physical restraints as much as possible in older patients</span> with delirium, as they can worsen distress and agitation, as well as contribute to preventable injuries.
- Pharmacotherapy
	- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|Antipsychotics]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotics]]: e.g., haloperidol (most commonly used)</span>
		- Atypical [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotic]] options
			- Risperidone
			- Olanzapine

>[!warning] 
>- Avoid [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotics]] in patients with underlying [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Alcohol withdrawal\|alcohol withdrawal]] or benzodiazepine withdrawal (due to the risk of seizures) and in patients at high risk for QTc prolongation (due to the risk of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Torsades de pointes\|torsades de pointes]]).
>- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|Benzodiazepines]] are deliriogenic. Do not treat delirious patients with [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|benzodiazepines]] unless the delirium is due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.
