- Adjustment disorder
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Etiology: a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic stressors (e.g., divorce, losing a job, academic failure, difficulties with a peer group, illness)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It's called "adjustment", because the stressor is mild and people just need to adjust.</span>
# Treatment
---
- First-line: psychotherapy with or without adjunctive pharmacotherapy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy</span>
	- Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing
- Pharmacotherapy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antidepressants\|SSRIs]]</span>, SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine)
	- Prazosin: for nightmares
	- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|Benzodiazepines]] should generally be avoided due to the risk of misuse and lack of evidence supporting the benefits.
