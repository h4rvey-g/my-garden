**Non-REM (NREM) Sleep**

- **N1 (Light Sleep)**
    
    - **EEG:** **Theta waves**.
    - **Description:** Transition from wakefulness to sleep (5% of total sleep). Very light sleep from which one is easily awakened.
    - **Physiology:** Slow, rolling eye movements.
- **N2 (Intermediate Sleep)**
    
    - **EEG:** **Sleep spindles** and **K-complexes** on a background of theta waves.
    - **Description:** Largest percentage of total sleep time (~45-55%). Deeper sleep than N1.
    - **Key Associations:** **Bruxism** (teeth grinding) often occurs during this stage.
- **N3 (Deep Sleep / Slow-Wave Sleep)**
    
    - **EEG:** **Delta waves** (low frequency, high amplitude).
    - **Description:** Deepest stage of sleep (~10-20% of total sleep), most difficult to awaken from. Most prominent in the first half of the night.
	    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The brain is "asleep" (high arousal threshold), but the motor system is not paralyzed, allowing for complex movements.</span> This is why parasomnias like **sleepwalking (somnambulism) and night terrors** occur during N3.
	    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">N3 sleep is considered the most physically restorative stage.</span> During this time, the body focuses on <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repair and growth</span>, such as tissue repair, bone and muscle building, and strengthening the immune system.
    - **Key Associations:** Parasomnias such as **somnambulism (sleepwalking), night terrors,** and **bedwetting (enuresis)** occur here.

**REM (Rapid Eye Movement) Sleep**

- **EEG:** **Beta waves** (high frequency, low amplitude), similar to the awake state; "sawtooth waves" are also characteristic.
- **Description:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">"Paradoxical sleep" as the brain is highly active while the body is immobile</span> (~20-25% of total sleep). Duration of REM periods increases with each cycle throughout the night.
	- **Not the "Deepest":** Although you are paralyzed, your arousal threshold during REM sleep is actually lower than in N3 sleep. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It is generally easier to wake someone from REM sleep. When awakened from REM, people often feel alert and can vividly recall their dreams</span>, unlike the grogginess ("sleep inertia") experienced when woken from N3.
- **Physiology:**
    - Rapid eye movements.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Atonia:** Generalized muscle paralysis (except for extraocular muscles and diaphragm). This is protective, preventing one from acting out dreams.</span>
    - Vivid dreaming and nightmares occur.
    - Variable heart rate and blood pressure, penile/clitoral tumescence.
- **Key Associations:**
    - Important for memory consolidation.
    - **Depression** is associated with increased total REM sleep and decreased REM latency (earlier onset of REM).
    - **REM sleep behavior disorder:** Loss of atonia leads to dream enactment (e.g., punching, kicking).

# Parasomnias
---
## Sleep terror disorder
- Definition: a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">non-REM-related</span> parasomnia that occurs during the N3 sleep stage (slow-wave sleep), characterized by episodes of sleep terror
- Epidemiology: Discrete episodes of sleep terrors are relatively <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">common in children</span> (∼ 20% of children and ∼ 2% of adults), but the disorder is rare.
- Risk factors
	- Stress or fatigue
	- Fever
	- Sleep deprivation
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Screaming or crying suddenly upon awakening, usually in the first part of the night</span> (rarely during daytime naps) 
	- Intense fear and agitation
	- Tachypnea, diaphoresis, tachycardia during episodes
	- Difficulty arousing patients during episodes
	- Patients usually return to sleep after the episode.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically no recollection of the arousal episode (unlike with nightmare disorder)</span>
		- Nightmare disorder
			- a REM-related parasomnia characterized by recurrent nightmares
			- Patient remembers the dream after awakening (<font color="#ffc000">REM</font>ember)
### REM sleep behavior disorder
- Definition: a REM-related parasomnia characterized by dream enactment due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of REM sleep atonia</span>
- Epidemiology
	- Sex: ♂ > ♀
	- Usually in older patients (> 50 years)
- Risk factors
	- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Narcolepsy\|Narcolepsy]]
	- Psychiatric medications (e.g., [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antidepressants\|antidepressants]])
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., [[USMLE/Neurology/Parkinson disease\|Parkinson disease]], [[USMLE/Neurology/Parkinson disease\|Lewy body dementia]])</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physically acting out dreams during sleep (e.g., yelling, moving limbs, walking, punching), sometimes leading to injury to self or others</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patient is alert and orientated after awakening, and remembers the dream.</span>
- Prognosis: Most patients with idiopathic RBD eventually develop a disorder of α-synuclein neurodegeneration, most commonly [[USMLE/Neurology/Parkinson disease\|Parkinson disease]].
