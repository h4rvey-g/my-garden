Definition: head trauma through strong rotational and shearing force
# Epidemiology
high mortality and a significant cause of death

---
# Etiology
violent shaking of a child

---
# Pathophysiology
- Rotational and shearing forces → shearing off of bridging veins → subdural hematoma
- Shaking of the child with a weak neck support → respiratory problems and apnea → hypoxia → brain edema and ischemia → diffuse axonal damage![Pasted image 20231002103937.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231002103937.png)

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subdural hematomas and/or [[USMLE/Neurology/Intracranial hemorrhage\|subarachnoid hemorrhage]]</span> of varying ages
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reversal sign: diffuse blurring of the grey-white matter interface</span>
