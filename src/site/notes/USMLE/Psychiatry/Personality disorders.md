# Cluster A
## Paranoid personality disorder
Don't trust others, but do not involve specific delusions (eg, persistent false, fixed beliefs).
## Schizoid personality disorder
- Voluntary detachment from social relationships (e.g., family)
- Comfortable with social isolation (unlike in avoidant personality disorder)
- The "schizo-" prefix is more of a historical artifact, reflecting an early conceptualization of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">profound social and emotional detachment as a form of "splitting" from the interpersonal world.</span> It does **not** imply the presence of psychotic symptoms or a direct progression to [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Schizophrenia\|schizophrenia]] in most cases. The key feature is a pervasive lack of interest in social interaction, not a distorted perception of reality.

## Schizotypal personality disorder
Unusual/magical thoughts, perceptions & behavior
# Cluster B
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antisocial and borderline tend to be severely socially disabling (e.g. cannot find a job or maintain a relationship), while histrionic and narcissistic are mild.</span>
## Borderline personality disorder
- It is called 'borderline' because doctors previously thought that it was on the border between two different disorders: neurosis and psychosis.
- Excessive impulsivity and unstable self-image, emotions, and relationships with others
- Often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">driven by abandonment fears</span>![Pasted image 20240317164528.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240317164528.png)
- Other features: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">splitting (psychiatry), a defense mechanism in which relationships are categorically good or bad</span>
