- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line: [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|benzodiazepines]]</span>
	- Shorter or intermediate-acting (e.g., oxazepam, lorazepam): Consider in patients with a slow metabolism (e.g., the elderly, those with liver failure).
	- Longer acting (e.g., chlordiazepoxide, diazepam): preferred in all other patients

>[!Mnemonic] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines all enhance GABA receptors, so their withdrawal syndromes share similar symptoms</span> (seizures, tachycardia, and tremors).
