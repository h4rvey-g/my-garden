- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exclusive [[USMLE/Reproductive/Infant nutrition and breastfeeding\|breastfeeding]]: low [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]] levels in breast milk (most important in late-onset VKDB)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|Vitamin K]] deficiency in the mother (e.g., because of anticonvulsant therapy; most important in early-onset VKDB; maternal malnutrition)</span>
- Underdeveloped intestinal flora (which produces [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]]), e.g., due to premature birth
- Long-term antibiotic treatment in newborns 
## Classification
