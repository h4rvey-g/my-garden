# Lymphocytosis
Lymphocytosis: > 33%
## Etiology
- Acute viral infections (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Rubella\|rubella]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Infectious mononucleosis\|infectious mononucleosis]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Mumps\|mumps]])
- Chronic bacterial infections
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bordetella [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pertussis\|pertussis]] ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Pertussis\|Whooping cough]])</span>
		- Often causes marked lymphocytosis, particularly in children
		- Can elevate lymphocyte counts to 20,000-30,000/μL or higher
	- Mycobacterium [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]]
		- Chronic [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|TB]] infection can produce lymphocytic responses
		- More common in the later stages of infection
	- Brucella species (Brucellosis)
		- Often presents with relative lymphocytosis
	- Treponema pallidum ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Syphilis\|Syphilis]])
		- Secondary and tertiary [[USMLE/Infective disease/Syphilis\|syphilis]] can produce lymphocytosis
	- Borrelia burgdorferi ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Lyme disease\|Lyme disease]])
		- Can cause lymphocytosis, especially in later stages
	- Mycoplasma pneumoniae
		- Often associated with atypical lymphocytes
- [[USMLE/Pathology/Cellular adaptations\|Neoplasia]] (e.g., [[USMLE/Blood/Hodgkin lymphoma\|Hodgkin lymphoma]], [[USMLE/Blood/Non-Hodgkin lymphomas\|non-Hodgkin lymphoma]], CLL)

## T cell activation
![Pasted image 20241230144106.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241230144106.png)
1. APC ingests and processes antigen, then migrates to the draining lymph node.
2. T-cell activation (signal 1): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exogenous antigen is presented on MHC II and recognized by TCR on Th (CD4+) cell. Endogenous or cross-presented antigen is presented on MHC I to Tc (CD8+) cell.</span>
3. Proliferation and survival (signal 2): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">costimulatory signal via interaction of B7 protein (CD80/86) on dendritic cell and CD28 on naïve T cell.</span>
	- Antigen presentation without this co-stimulatory signal will lead to T-cell anergy:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Important self-tolerance mechanism</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The cell will not be activated even though it is exposed to its antigen</span>
	- Superantigens (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Toxic shock syndrome\|toxic shock syndrome]] toxin 1, enterotoxin B) link MHC II antigen-presenting cells and T-cell receptors on T cells and lead to activation of T cells without a costimulatory signal.
4. Activated Th cell produces cytokines. Tc cell able to recognize and kill virus-infected cell.

## T-cell development
- Positive selection of T cells: ensures that the thymus produces functional T cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Location: thymic cortex</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thymic cortical cells express MHC class I and MHC class II antigens.</span>
	- Tests if T-cell receptors can bind to MHC appropriately (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not too strongly or too weakly</span>)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cells (CD4+/CD8+, double-positive thymocytes) receive survival signal.</span>
		- Dysfunctional T cells then undergo apoptosis.
- Negative selection of T cells: ensures that the thymus does not produce self-reacting T cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Location: thymic medulla</span>
	- Tests if T cells bind to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tissue-restricted self-antigens presented on MHC by thymic medullary cells</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cells that do not bind receive survival signal.</span>
		- T cells that bind self-antigens undergo apoptosis, except for a few that become regulatory T cells.
	- Self-antigen presentation is mediated by the autoimmune regulator protein (AIRE protein), dysfunction of which can lead to:
		- Adrenal insufficiency
		- Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
		- Hypoparathyroidism

## B cell activation and class switching
![Pasted image 20241230145031.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241230145031.png)
1. Th-cell activation as above.
2. B-cell receptor–mediated endocytosis.
	- B lymphocytes recognize antigens via their B-cell receptors (membrane‑bound immunoglobulins, IgD or IgM) → B cell receptor-mediated endocytosis of the BCR/antigen complex → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">breakdown of antigen into small fragments by lysosomal proteases → presentation of antigen fragment via MHC class II receptors on B cell surface to Th cells plus costimulation of B cell CD40 receptor by Th cell CD40L</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cell‑dependent activation of B cells (plasma cells)</span> → immunoglobulin production
	- B cell and T cell need to be <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activated by the same antigen</span>
3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exogenous antigen is presented on MHC II and recognized by TCR on Th cell.</span>
4. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD40 receptor on B cell binds CD40 ligand (CD40L) on Th cell.</span>
5. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th cells secrete cytokines that determine Ig class switching of B cells.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Th1 (IFN-γ)**, **Th2 (IL-4)**, **Tfh (IL-21)**, **Th17 (IL-21)**: stimulates class switching to IgG.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Th2 (IL-4, IL-13)**: stimulate class switching to IgE.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Th2 (IL-5) + Treg (TGF-β)**: stimulate class switching to IgA.</span>
6. B cells are activated and produce IgM. They undergo class switching and affinity maturation.
