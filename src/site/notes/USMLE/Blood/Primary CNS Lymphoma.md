- **Patho/Etiology**
    - Rare, aggressive extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the brain, spinal cord, meninges, or eyes.
    - Most are **Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)**.
    - Strong association with **immunosuppression** (e.g., HIV/AIDS, post-transplant).
    - In immunocompromised patients, it is almost always associated with **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**.

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - Symptoms depend on tumor location.
    - **Focal neurologic deficits** (e.g., hemiparesis, aphasia) are common (70% of patients).
    - **Neuropsychiatric symptoms** (e.g., personality changes, confusion, memory loss) occur in about 43% of cases.
    - Seizures are less common than in other brain tumors.
    - Ocular symptoms (e.g., blurry vision, floaters) can occur with intraocular involvement.

- **Diagnosis**
    - **MRI with contrast** is the imaging modality of choice.
        - **Immunocompetent:** Typically a **solitary**, intensely and homogeneously enhancing periventricular mass. May cross the corpus callosum.![Pasted image 20250716210247.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250716210247.png)
        - **Immunocompromised:** Often multiple, **ring-enhancing** lesions, making it hard to distinguish from toxoplasmosis.
    - **Stereotactic brain biopsy** is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. **Corticosteroids should be withheld before biopsy** as they are lymphocytotoxic and can lead to a non-diagnostic ("disappearing") lesion.
    - CSF analysis may show malignant lymphocytes; in immunocompromised patients, **CSF PCR for EBV DNA** is highly specific.

- **DDx (of a Ring-Enhancing Lesion)**
    - **Brain Abscess:** Often has a smoother, thinner ring and a central area of high signal (pus) on DWI.
    - **Toxoplasmosis:** Key differential in HIV+ patients. Usually multiple lesions, often in basal ganglia. Empiric anti-toxo therapy (pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine) is often tried first in this population.
    - **Glioblastoma:** Typically occurs in older, immunocompetent patients; shows irregular, thick-walled ring enhancement with central necrosis.
    - **Metastases:** Often multiple lesions located at the gray-white matter junction; patient usually has a known primary cancer.

- **Management/Treatment**
    - **High-dose Methotrexate (HD-MTX)**-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment. Rituximab is often added.
    - Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) may be used as consolidation but is associated with significant long-term **neurotoxicity**, especially in older patients.
    - Corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone) are used to reduce peritumoral edema and symptoms but are not a long-term treatment.
    - In younger, fit patients, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (HDC-ASCT) may be used for consolidation.

- **Key Associations/Complications**
    - **Prognosis** is generally poor, though it has improved with modern therapies; median survival is now 30-60 months. Untreated, survival is only a few months.
    - **WBRT-induced neurotoxicity** is a major complication, causing dementia, gait instability, and incontinence, particularly in patients >60 years old.
    - Relapse is common, occurring in up to 50% of patients within the first two years.
