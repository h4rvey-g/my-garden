# Clinical features
## Indolent (low-grade)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Follicular lymphoma</span>	
	- Most common low-grade lymphoma in adults
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slowly progressive and painless course with an alternating (waxing and waning) pattern of [[USMLE/Pathology/Lymphadenopathy\|lymphadenopathy]] and [[USMLE/Blood/Splenomegaly\|splenomegaly]]</span>
	- Translocation t(14;18), which involves the heavy-chain Ig (chromosome 14) and Bcl-2 gene (chromosome 18) → overexpression of Bcl-2 → dysregulation of apoptosis (normally inhibited by Bcl-2)
	- Centrocyte: nodular, small cells with cleaved nuclei![highresdefault_L79513.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L79513.jpg)
## Aggressive (high-grade)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Burkitt lymphoma</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common in children</span> 
	- Translocation t(8;14) in 75% of cases: reciprocal translocation involving the c-myc gene (chromosome 8) and heavy-chain Ig locus (chromosome 14) → overactivation of c-myc proto-oncogene → activation of transcription
	- Forms
		- Sporadic: typically located in the abdomen or pelvis
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endemic: associated with [[USMLE/Infective disease/Infectious mononucleosis\|EBV]] (most prevalent in equatorial Africa and South America) and is typically located in the maxillary and mandibular bones</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Immunology/Congenital immunodeficiency disorders\|Immunodeficiency]]-associated: e.g. [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV infection]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Starry sky pattern </span> (See below)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nonendemic BL often involves the gastrointestinal tract, which can present as an enlarging abdominal mass with ascites (due to lymph obstruction) and distention and obstruction.</span>
