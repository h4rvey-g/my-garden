- HbF: has <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">significantly higher oxygen affinity</span> than adult hemoglobin A.  This allows fetal hemoglobin to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extract more oxygen from the mother's adult hemoglobin in the placenta</span>, providing the developing fetus with an adequate supply of oxygen.
- HbS: Point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid by valine
- HbC: Point mutation in the β-globin gene resulting in the replacement of glutamic acid by lysine

- Normal hemoglobin consists primarily of hemoglobin A (HbA), which migrates rapidly toward the positive electrode (anode) because of its negative charge.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoglobin S (HbS) </span>is an abnormal type of hemoglobin in which a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nonpolar amino acid (valine) replaces a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) in the beta globin chain.</span>  This amino acid replacement decreases the negative charge on the HbS molecule, which causes HbS to move more slowly toward the anode. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glutamate (-) → Valine (=)</span>
- Similarly, hemoglobin C (HbC) has a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">glutamate residue replaced by lysine</span> in the beta globin chain.  Because lysine is a positively charged amino acid, HbC has even less total negative charge than HbS and moves even more slowly toward the anode.  Both HbC and HbS result from missense mutations, a type of mutation in which a single base substitution results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid.
