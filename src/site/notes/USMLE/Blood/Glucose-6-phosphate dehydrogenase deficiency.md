# Pathophysiology

- X-linked recessive inheritance
- G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt). This pathway yields NADPH, which is essential for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">converting oxidized glutathione back to its reduced form.</span> Reduced glutathione is capable of neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals and therefore protecting RBCs from oxidative damage. 
- In the absence of reduced glutathione (e.g., due to G6PD deficiency), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">RBCs become susceptible to oxidative stress that can damage erythrocyte membranes, resulting in intravascular and [[USMLE/Blood/Lab findings of hemolysis\|extravascular hemolysis]].</span>
- Causes of increased oxidative stress are triggers of hemolytic crisis and include:
	- Fava beans
	- Drugs: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antimalarial drugs</span> (e.g., chloroquine, primaquine), <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sulfa drugs</span> (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]], ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bacterial and viral infections (most common cause)</span>: Severe enzymatic deficiency can inhibit respiratory burst activity due to reduced NADPH production in phagocytes. 
	- Inflammation: During an inflammatory reaction free radicals are produced and can diffuse into RBCs.

# Clinical features
---
- Most patients are asymptomatic.
- Recurring hemolytic crises may occur, especially following triggers
	- Arise within 2â€“3 days after increased oxidative stress 
	- Sudden onset of back or abdominal pain
	- Jaundice
	- [[USMLE/Renal/Urine color\|Dark urine]] 
	- Transient [[USMLE/Blood/Splenomegaly\|splenomegaly]]
- Recurrent severe infections causing symptoms of [[USMLE/Immunology/Chronic granulomatous disease\|chronic granulomatous disease]]
