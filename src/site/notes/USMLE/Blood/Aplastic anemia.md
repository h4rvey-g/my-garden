- Description
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|Pancytopenia]] caused by bone marrow insufficiency </span>
	- Should not be confused with aplastic crisis, a condition in which erythropoiesis is temporarily suppressed (e.g., due to [[USMLE/Infective disease/Parvovirus B19\|parvovirus B19]] infection in patients with hemolytic anemias)
- Etiology
	- Idiopathic in > 50% of cases
		- Possibly immune-mediated
		- May follow acute hepatitis (hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Medication side effects</span>: [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|carbamazepine]], methimazole, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]], chloramphenicol, propylthiouracil, sulfa drugs, cytostatic drugs (esp. alkylating agents and antimetabolites)
		- Dose-dependent reactions are caused by medications (eg, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chemotherapy, immunosuppressives</span>) that are toxic to the bone marrow when drug levels exceed a certain concentration for a certain period.  They tend to be predictable in onset.
		- Idiosyncratic reactions are often caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antiseizure medications</span> (eg, [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|carbamazepine]], [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|valproic acid]]), sulfonamides, or nifedipine.  They are unpredictable, unrelated to the dose of the drug, and may occur at any point during or after therapy.  Although the mechanism is unclear, patients often have genetic mutations in drug-metabolizing enzymes or efflux pumps, which may promote toxicity.
	- Toxins: benzene, cleaning solvents, insecticides, toluene
	- Ionizing radiation
	- Viruses: [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|HBV]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Infectious mononucleosis\|EBV]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Cytomegalovirus infection\|CMV]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fanconi anemia</span>
		- Hereditary autosomal recessive disorder due to a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DNA crosslink repair defect resulting in bone marrow failure</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skeletal and organ abnormalities: short stature, hypo- and hyperpigmentation, cafe-au-lait spots, microcephaly, developmental delay, thumb and forearm malformations, kidney, GI, heart, eye, and ear abnormalities</span>
		- Laboratory tests show <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]] and normocytic or macrocytic anemia.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">�?50% of patients with Fanconi anemia will develop [[USMLE/Blood/Acute leukemia\|acute myeloid leukemia]] or [[USMLE/Blood/Myelodysplastic syndromes\|myelodysplastic syndromes]] in early adulthood.</span>
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells are destroyed by cytotoxic T cells</span> or direct cytotoxic injury �?bone marrow aplasia/hypoplasia �?lack of circulating peripheral blood cells

>	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Evidence of extra medullary hematopoesis</span>
>- Aplastic anemia: no
>- Explanation: In myeloproliferative disorders like myelofibrosis, niche in marrow is disturbed by slow fibrosis of marrow so <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stem cells migrate and extra medullary haematopoiesis occurs</span>. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">But in aplastic anemia</span> (whether primary or secondary to drugs etc) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stem cells themselves are destroyed or affected so haematopoiesis not possible anywhere.</span> So we don't get hepatosplenomegaly and other evidences of extramedullary haematopoiesis.

- Diagnostics
	- Laboratory studies, e.g.:
		- CBC: pancytopenia (in contrast to aplastic crisis characterized by anemia only), or normocytic or macrocytic anemia
		- Reticulocyte count: low
		- Erythropoietin level: high
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone marrow findings: hypocellular with prominent fat spaces (“empty marrow�?appearance)</span>![L68294.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L68294.jpg)
- Treatment
	- Consider need for supportive care, e.g.:
		- Platelet transfusions, and/or blood transfusions
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone marrow stimulants (e.g., GM-CSF, eltrombopag)</span>
	- Manage the underlying cause (e.g., cessation of the causative agent, or treatment of infections)
	- If no cause is identified, treatment for idiopathic aplastic anemia may include:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunosuppressive therapy</span> to prevent further autoimmune marrow destruction
			- Cyclosporine
			- Antithymocyte globulin
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Consider hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients under 50 years of age</span> with a suitable stem cell donor.
