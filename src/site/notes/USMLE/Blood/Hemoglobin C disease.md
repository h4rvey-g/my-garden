# Definition
---
- Hemoglobin C disease: occurs in individuals who are homozygous for the hemoglobin C mutation (HbCC)
- Hemoglobin C trait: occurs in individuals who are heterozygous carriers of the hemoglobin C mutation (HbAC)

# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---
Glutamic acid can also be replaced with a lysine, creating hemoglobin C.

- β-globin mutation (glutamate replaced by lysine)
- HbC is less soluble than HbA and tends to form hexagonal crystals, which lead to RBC dehydration (�?MCHC).
- RBCs have reduced oxygen-binding capacity and a shorter lifespan.
