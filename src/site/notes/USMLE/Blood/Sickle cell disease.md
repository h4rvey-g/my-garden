# Pathophysiology
- Point mutation in the β-globin gene (chromosome 11) → glutamic acid replaced with valine (single amino acid substitution) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">2 α-globin and 2 mutated β-globin subunits create pathological [[USMLE/Blood/Hemoglobin variants\|hemoglobin]] S (HbS)</span>.
	- Heterozygotes (HbAS): carry one sickle allele and one other (usually normal) → sickle cell trait
	- Homozygotes (HbSS): carry two sickle alleles → sickle cell anemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing deformation of erythrocytes (“sickling”).</span> This can be triggered by any event associated with reduced oxygen tension.
	> Formation of a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydrophobic pocket</span> on the beta globin surface that interacts with a complementary nonpolar residue on another hemoglobin molecule.  The hydrophobic interaction causes polymerization of HbS molecules and subsequent erythrocyte sickling, leading to membrane damage and permanent distortion of red blood cells.
	- Hypoxia (e.g., at high altitudes)
		- In homozygotes, up to 100% of the [[USMLE/Blood/Hemoglobin variants\|hemoglobin]] molecules are affected, leading to sickle cell formation under minimally decreased oxygen tension.
		- In heterozygotes, sickling only occurs due to severe reduction in oxygen tension.
	- Infections
	- Dehydration
	- Acidosis
	- Sudden changes in temperature
	- Stress
- Sickle cells lack elasticity and adhere to vascular endothelium, which disrupts microcirculation and causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vascular occlusion and subsequent tissue infarction</span>.
- Hemolysis and the subsequent <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased turnover of erythrocytes may increase the demand for folate, causing folate deficiency.</span>
	- Can present as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">macrocytic anemia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Blood/Lab findings of hemolysis\|Extravascular hemolysis]] and [[USMLE/Blood/Lab findings of hemolysis\|intravascular hemolysis]] are common and result in anemia.</span>

# Clinical features
Typically manifests <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">after 3–6 months of age</span> as the production of HbF decreases and HbS levels increase
## Acute manifestations
- Vaso-occlusive events
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dactylitis in children &lt; 5 years of age</span> 
		- Typically the earliest manifestation of sickle cell disease
		- Most common in children <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">between 6 months and 2 years</span> of age; uncommon in older children and adults
		- Swelling, tenderness, and warmth![Pasted image 20241014110318.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241014110318.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vasoocclusive crises (sickle cell pain crisis) </span>
		- Most common acute complication of sickle cell disease 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Characterized by recurrent episodes of severe throbbing or sharp pain</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically affects the limbs, chest, and back and lasts for ∼ 7 days</span>
		- Often associated with other vasoocclusive events (especially dactylitis in children)
	- Acute chest syndrome
	- Priapism
	- Stroke (common in children)
	- Sickle cell hepatopathy
	- Organ infarctions (any organ; particularly the spleen)
	- Avascular necrosis

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal RBC indices (e.g. MCV)</span>
	- Not all red blood cells are sickled

# Treatment
## Overview
### Infants and children
- Antibiotic prophylaxis against invasive pneumococcal disease until 5 years of age
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxyurea therapy</span> regardless of clinical severity to minimize disease-related complications **(First-line)**
- Annual transcranial doppler to screen for stroke risk from 2 months till 16 years of age
### Hydroxyurea therapy
#### Indications
- All infants > 9 months, children, and adolescents with sickle cell anemia regardless of symptom severity 
- Adults with any of the following:
	- Frequent (≥ 3 episodes/year) acute pain episodes or other vasoocclusive events
	- Severe symptomatic anemia
	- History of severe and/or recurrent acute chest syndrome
#### Mechanism of action
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulation of erythropoiesis and increased fetal [[USMLE/Blood/Hemoglobin variants\|hemoglobin]]</span>

# Complications
## Splenic sequestration
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">splenic vasoocclusion and entrapment and pooling of large amounts of blood in the spleen</span>
- Clinical presentation
	- Most commonly affects children < 5 years of age
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute left upper quadrant pain, [[USMLE/Blood/Splenomegaly\|splenomegaly]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypotension and/or hypovolemic shock</span>, especially in infants
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Due to the trapping of blood in the spleen</span>
	- Symptoms of anemia (e.g., pallor, fatigue)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Functional [[USMLE/Blood/Asplenia\|asplenia]]: Increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Streptococcus pneumoniae\|Streptococcus pneumoniae]] (most common), Neisseria [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Haemophilus influenzae\|Haemophilus influenzae]] type b</span>
- Supportive findings 
	- Anemia (Hb drop of ≥ 2 g/dL) with reticulocytosis
	- Thrombocytopenia
- Acute management
	- Immediate IV fluid resuscitation for hypovolemia
	- Simple RBC [[USMLE/Blood/Transfusion\|transfusion]] in consultation with a sickle cell expert (avoid raising hemoglobin > 8 g/dL)
