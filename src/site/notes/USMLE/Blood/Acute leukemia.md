# Epidemiology
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
	- Peak incidence: 2–5 years
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common malignant disease in children</span>
	- ∼ 80% of acute leukemias during childhood are lymphoblastic.

---
# Etiology
## Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
- Genetic or chromosomal factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Down syndrome\|Down syndrome]]: Risk of ALL is, like that of AML, 10–20 times higher in patients with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Down syndrome\|Down syndrome]] compared to the general population.</span>
	- [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurocutaneous disorders\|Neurofibromatosis]] type 1
	- [[USMLE/Neurology/Ataxia-telangiectasia\|Ataxia telangiectasia]]

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Oncologic emergencies can be the first sign of leukemia, e.g., an elderly patient presenting with priapism or DIC may have leukostasis (more common in AML than ALL)
>[!warning] 
>The identification of DIC suggests APL, which is a medical emergency. Consult hematology and/or oncology immediately and transfer the patient to a critical care unit.

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MPO and LAP</span>
>- MPO (Myeloperoxidase)
>	- Primary marker for identifying cells of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myeloid lineage</span>
>	- Can help distinguish Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL):
>		- AML cells are typically MPO positive
>		- ALL cells are MPO negative
>- LAP ([[USMLE/Blood/Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase\|Leukocyte Alkaline Phosphatase]])
>	- Enzyme present in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mature neutrophils</span>
>	- LAP score helps differentiate between various myeloproliferative conditions:
> 	   - Elevated in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">infections</span>, inflammatory conditions, and [[USMLE/Blood/Polycythemia vera\|polycythemia vera]]
> 	   - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low or absent in [[USMLE/Blood/Chronic myeloid leukemia\|Chronic Myeloid Leukemia]] (CML)</span>
> 			- **CML**: All neutrophils are clonal (_BCR-ABL1+_), dysfunctional, and LAP-negative due to stem-cell-level dominance. 
> 			- **AML**: Residual neutrophils are derived from **non-clonal, normal stem cells** that escape leukemic transformation, retaining LAP activity.
>	- Particularly valuable in distinguishing CML from leukemoid reaction:
> 	   - CML: Low LAP score
> 	   - Leukemoid reaction: High LAP score

## AML vs CML

| **Feature**         | **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**                                                         | **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Onset & Cells**   | Rapid; ≥20% Myeloblasts                                                                  | Gradual; Mature & maturing granulocytes, <10% blasts (chronic phase)                   |
| **Age (Typical)**   | Older adults (can occur at any age)                                                      | Middle-aged to older adults                                                            |
| **Key Genetic**     | Various (e.g., t(15;17) in APL, FLT3)                                                    | **Philadelphia Chromosome (t(9;22) -> BCR-ABL)**                                       |
| **Auer Rods**       | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**May be present**</span>                | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absent</span>                          |
| **LAP Score**       | Variable (often normal/high)                                                             | **Low**                                                                                |

| **Splenomegaly**    | Less common / less massive                                                               | **Common, often massive**                                                              |
| **Symptoms**        | Acute: Pancytopenia symptoms (fatigue, bleeding, infection)                              | Chronic phase often asymptomatic or mild (fatigue, weight loss)                        |
| **Basophilia**      | Not prominent                                                                            | **Often present**                                                                      |
| **Treatment Focus** | Induction Chemotherapy (e.g., 7+3); ATRA for APL                                         | **Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs)** (e.g., Imatinib)                                 |
| **Progression**     | Aggressive from onset                                                                    | Chronic -> Accelerated -> Blast Crisis (can resemble AML)                              |
- For WBC Count:
	- AML: Rapid takeover by non-functional blasts, which can lead to variable peripheral counts as they either spill out or cause marrow failure.
	- CML: Chronic overproduction of a whole spectrum of maturing (but abnormal) granulocytes, leading to consistently high counts.
- **For Splenomegaly:**
	- **AML:** Acute disease course often doesn't allow enough time for massive splenic infiltration before other critical symptoms arise from marrow failure.
	- **CML:** Chronic proliferation leads to significant extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen over time, resulting in marked enlargement.
