# Etiology
---
## By RBC pathology

- **Intrinsic hemolytic anemia**
    - Increased destruction of RBCs due to a defect within the RBC
- **Extrinsic hemolytic anemia**
    - Abnormal breakdown of normal RBCs

## By location of RBC breakdown

- **Intravascular hemolytic anemia**
    - Increased destruction of RBCs within the blood vessels
- **Extravascular hemolytic anemia**
    - Increased destruction of RBCs by the reticuloendothelial system (primarily the spleen)

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin</span>
	- Hemolysis → Hb release → heme catabolized to indirect bilirubin
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More prominent in extravascular hemolysis</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Heme needs to be catabolized to indirect bilirubin. Macrophages within the reticuloendothelial system (80% in the spleen and 20% in the bone marrow) are predominantly responsible for heme breakdown.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoglobinuria, Hemosiderinuria</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More prominent in intravascular hemolysis</span>
		- Free Hb can't be catabolized, so they are excreted in urine.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</span>
	- Nonspecific parameter; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">indicates increased cellular breakdown</span>
	- More prominent in intravascular hemolysis
- Peripheral blood smear
	- Intravascular hemolysis
		- ↑ Reticulocytes
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Heinz bodies and bite cells in G6PD deficiency </span> 
		- Schistocytes in MAHA or macroangiopathic hemolysis 
		- Intracellular organisms (e.g., in malaria , babesiosis , bartonellosis )
	- Extravascular hemolysis
		- ↑ Reticulocytes
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spherocytes in hereditary spherocytosis and immune-mediated hemolysis (e.g., warm AIHA, hemolytic transfusion reactions)</span>
			- Spherocytes are typically found in warm AIHA due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">splenic macrophages partially ingesting IgG-coated RBC membranes</span>. A positive DAT and negative family history can distinguish warm AIHA from hereditary spherocytosis.
		- RBC agglutination in cold agglutinin disease (CAD) 
		- Sickle cells in sickle cell disease 
		- Target cells in HbC disease, Asplenia, Liver disease, Thalassemia
			- A type of pathologic red blood cell with a bullseye appearance due to an overabundance of membrane.
			- “<font color="#ffc000">HALT</font>,” said the hunter to his <font color="#ffc000">target</font>
		- Teardrop cells in thalassemia
		- Hb crystals within RBCs in hemoglobin C disease
		- Smudge cells (Gumprecht shadows) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
