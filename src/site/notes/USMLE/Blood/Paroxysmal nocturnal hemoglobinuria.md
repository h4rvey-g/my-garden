An acquired genetic defect of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a triad of hemolytic [[USMLE/Blood/Anemia\|anemia]], [[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]], and thrombosis</span>

# Pathophysiology
- Physiologically, a membrane-bound glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">protects RBCs against [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]]-mediated hemolysis.</span>
- Acquired mutation on the PIGA gene located on the X chromosome → GPI anchor loses its protective effect → RBC destruction by [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] and reticuloendothelial system → intravascular and [[USMLE/Blood/Lab findings of hemolysis\|extravascular hemolysis]]
- The GPI anchor proteins involved in PNH are:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD55</span>/DAF (Decay-accelerating factor)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CD59</span>/MIRL (Membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis)![0c4abbceeb2a64bddf60c772faad8b4.jpg](/img/user/appendix/0c4abbceeb2a64bddf60c772faad8b4.jpg)
- PNH can also occur in patients with aplastic [[USMLE/Blood/Anemia\|anemia]] and [[USMLE/Blood/Myelodysplastic syndromes\|MDS]].

# Clinical features
---
- Pallor, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excessive fatigue</span>, weakness
- Intermittent jaundice
- Episodes of hemoglobinuria causing pink/red/[[USMLE/Renal/Urine color\|dark urine]] which usually occurs in the morning due to the concentration of urine overnight.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vasoconstriction</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The scavenging of nitric oxide by free Hb results in smooth muscle contraction.</span>
	- Headache, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|pulmonary hypertension]]
	- Abdominal pain, dysphagia, erectile dysfunction
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venous thrombosis in unusual locations (e.g., hepatic, cerebral, and/or abdominal veins)</span>
	- Hemolysis generates free Hb, which scavenges serum nitric oxide (a [[USMLE/REVIEW/Vasodilators\|vasodilator]]), causing vasoconstriction.
	- Free Hb also promotes oxidative stress, which activates the endothelium of blood vessels, inducing platelet aggregation.
- Increased risk of infections (in case of [[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]])

# Diagnostics
- CBC: anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or [[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]] ; usually ↑ reticulocytes
- Hemolysis workup: ↓ haptoglobin
- Direct Coombs test: negative  
	- [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]]-mediated RBC destruction
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flow cytometry of peripheral blood (confirmatory test for PNH): can show deficiency of GPI-linked proteins on the surface of RBCs and WBCs (e.g., CD55, CD59) </span>

---
# Treatment
- Indications include severe anemia, thrombosis, severe fatigue, pain crises, and end-organ damage
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line treatment: complement inhibition with an anti-C5 antibody (e.g., eculizumab, ravulizumab)</span>![Pasted image 20250707203928.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250707203928.png)
