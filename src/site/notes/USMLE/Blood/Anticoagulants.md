# Physiologic anticoagulants
- Inhibit intrinsic pathway: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antithrombin (with heparin): inhibit factor 2(thrombin), 9, 10, 11, 12</span>
	- [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|Protein C]]: inhibit 5, 8; need VitK to synthesize
- Inhibit extrinsic pathway:
	- TFPI(Tissue factor pathway inhibitor): combine factor 10 to inhibit factor 8
# Oral anticoagulants

>[!tip] 
>- Heparin: also affects VIII and IX -> intrinsic pathway -> PTT
>- Warfarin: affects both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but VII has shorter half life → extrinsic pathway → PT</span>
>	- The half-lives of the procoagulants are ∼ 2–4 days (except for factor VII, which has a short half-life), while the anticoagulants only have half-lives of 6–10 hours.
>	- Intrinsic pathway remains active another 2–3 days, while extrinsic pathway and [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] are already inactive.

- Direct thrombin inhibitors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prolonged thrombin time (TT), no change to PTT or PT (not routinely monitored)</span>
- Direct factor Xa inhibitors: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prolonged PT and PTT, unchanged thrombin time (not routinely monitored)

## Adverse effects
### Warfarin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Warfarin-induced skin necrosis</span>
	- Seen within the first few days of treatment with high doses of warfarin
	- Warfarin inhibits all [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]]-dependent coagulation factors:  anticoagulants<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] and protein S have a relatively short half-life and are depleted more quickly</span> than procoagulants factors II, IX, and X  → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased factor V and VIII activity (which [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] and S normally inactivate)  → initial hypercoagulable state  → formation of microthrombi → vascular occlusion, tissue infarction, and blood extravasation</span>
	- Increased risk in patients with underlying hereditary [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] deficiency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Presentation: painful purpura, hemorrhagic blisters, and large areas of necrosis; mostly affects subcutaneous adipose tissue </span>![Pasted image 20240306171857.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240306171857.png)
	- Immediate management: discontinue warfarin, administer IV [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]], unfractionated heparin, and source of [[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] ([[USMLE/Blood/Inhibition of hemostasis\|protein C]] concentrate, FFP); surgical debridement and grafting in therapy-refractory cases
	- Prevention: temporary <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bridging anticoagulation</span> with heparin until warfarin has started to act and the initial hypercoagulable state has been bridged

## Warfarin reversal
### Active hemorrhage (regardless of INR)

|         | Warfarin overdose                                                      | Heparin overdose                                                                  |

- Stop warfarin.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Administer IV [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]] PLUS 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">If PCC is unavailable, give fresh frozen plasma (FFP)</span>
- Monitor INR every 6 hours until warfarin has been fully reversed (INR ≤ 1.1)
## Warfarin interactions
---
Warfarin is metabolized by [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|cytochrome P450]] (CYP) enzymes.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decrease of anticoagulant effect</span>
	- Rifampicin, [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|carbamazepine]], St. John's wort, ginger, licorice: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">induce metabolic breakdown of warfarin via induction of [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|cytochrome P450]]</span>
	- Foods rich in [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]] (e.g., kale, spinach): counter effect of warfarin
	- Gastric acid inhibition ([[USMLE/GI/Proton pump inhibitors\|PPI]] use), cholestyramine treatment: impaired uptake of warfarin
- Increase of anticoagulant effect
	- Several [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antidepressants\|antidepressants]] and [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|antibiotics]], [[USMLE/GI/Proton pump inhibitors\|PPIs]], amiodarone, grapefruit: impair metabolic breakdown via inhibition of [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|cytochrome P450]]
	- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|Acetaminophen]]: metabolite of [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|acetaminophen]] interrupts [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]] cycle via inhibition of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]]-dependent carboxylase
	- Sulfonamides, sulfonylureas: competitively block or displace warfarin at plasma protein binding sites
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Damage to gut flora (e.g., antibiotic therapy): impaired bacterial [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin K\|vitamin K]] synthesis</span>

### Bridging anticoagulation
- Bridging anticoagulation: the administration of heparin for the duration of the transient hypercoagulable state caused by warfarin therapy. Heparin prevents coagulation by activating antithrombin.
	- Reduces risk of venous thromboembolism and skin necrosis
	- May also be used during interruptions of warfarin therapy (e.g., surgery)
- Periprocedural bridging anticoagulation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because the effect of coumarin can last several days, it is necessary to switch to heparins before surgery (preferably LMWH) to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding.</span>
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interrupt VKAs as needed (e.g., patients with high periprocedural bleeding risk) a few days before the procedure.</span>
	2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initiate bridging anticoagulation once the INR is in the subtherapeutic range,</span>
	3. Administer the last dose of LMWH 24 hours before the procedure (4–6 hours before the procedure for UFH).
	4. Resume VKA after surgery ; consider postprocedural bridging anticoagulation as needed (e.g., patients with high periprocedural thrombotic risk.
# Parenteral anticoagulation
---
## Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antidote: protamine sulfate</span> (a positively-charged protein that can neutralize negatively-charged heparin by forming inactive complexes)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Can't give fresh frozen plasma (FFP), since it contains antithrombin III → enhances heparin effect</span>
## Direct thrombin inhibitors
- Drugs: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">argatroban, bivalirudin, desirudin, dabigatran</span>
- Mechanism
	- Directly inhibit thrombin (freely circulating and in association with clots)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Act independently from antithrombin</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The effect of most parenteral anticoagulants (except for direct thrombin inhibitors) works by enhancing native antithrombin III.</span>
- Administration
	- Intravenous: argatroban, bivalirudin, desirudin
	- Oral: dabigatran (see direct oral thrombin inhibitors)
- Monitoring during therapy: not generally recommended 
- Antidote
	- Possibly aPCC and/or antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid)
	- Dabigatran: idarucizumab (monoclonal antibody)
