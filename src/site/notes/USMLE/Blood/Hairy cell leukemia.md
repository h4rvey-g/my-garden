- Epidemiology
	- Most common in middle-aged men
	- ♂ > ♀ (4:1)
- Pathology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mature B-cell tumor</span>; BRAF mutations are common
	- Crucially, these hairy cells stimulate the production of reticulin fibers within the bone marrow. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This leads to bone marrow fibrosis.</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptomatic [[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]]</span> (due to bone marrow fibrosis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Massive [[USMLE/Blood/Splenomegaly\|splenomegaly]]</span>
	- No [[USMLE/Pathology/Lymphadenopathy\|lymphadenopathy]]
	- B symptoms are rare.
- Diagnostics
	- Usually tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain positive
	- Flow cytometry (preferred over TRAP stain): CD11c marker
	- CBC: Leucopenia is common but up to 20% of patients have leukocytosis.
