# Sources of exposure
- Fires: Cyanide is released by various substances during combustion (e.g., plastics, upholstery, rubber).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Long-term or high-dose treatment with sodium nitroprusside, especially in individuals with chronic renal failure</span>
	- Sodium nitroprusside releases cyanide ions.
- Industrial: metal industry, manufacture of nitrogen-containing materials and products (plastics and wool), electroplating
## Pathophysiology
- Binds to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ferric ions</span> in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cytochrome oxidase IV</span> within the mitochondria → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blocks the electron transport chain → ↓ oxidative phosphorylation → anaerobic metabolism, ↑ lactic acid, hypoxia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Respiratory/Oxygen dissociation curve\|Oxygen dissociation curve]] is usually normal (opposed to carbon monoxide poisoning)</span>
# Differential diagnostics
## Cyanide poisoning vs CO poisoning

| Feature                | Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning                                                                 | Cyanide (CN) Poisoning                                                                       | Methemoglobinemia (MetHb)                                                                     |

| **Mechanism**          | Binds Hemoglobin (forms COHb) → ↓ O2 carrying & delivery.                                      | Inhibits Cytochrome C Oxidase (Complex IV) → blocks ATP prod.                                | Iron in heme oxidized (Fe2+ → Fe3+) → cannot bind O2.                                         |
| **Source**             | Incomplete combustion (fires, car exhaust, faulty heaters).                                    | Fires (plastics, wool), industrial, nitroprusside.                                           | Oxidizing drugs (dapsone, nitrites, benzocaine), G6PD deficiency.                             |
| **Presentation**       | Headache, dizziness, N/V. **Cherry-red skin** (late, unreliable). **Normal SaO2** on pulse ox. | Rapid onset: confusion, seizures, coma. **Cherry-red skin**. **Almond breath** (unreliable). | **Cyanosis** (dusky/brown skin/blood) unresponsive to O2. Dyspnea.                            |
| **Dx**                 | ↑ COHb level (CO-oximetry). Pulse ox misleadingly normal.                                      | ↑ Lactate. Clinical suspicion + history. High venous O2.                                     | ↑ MetHb level (co-oximetry). **"Saturation gap"** (pulse ox ~85%). **Chocolate-brown blood**. |
| **Tx**                 | **100% O2**. Hyperbaric O2 (HBO) if severe.                                                    | **Hydroxycobalamin** or Nitrites + Sodium Thiosulfate.                                       | **Methylene blue**. O2. (Avoid MB in G6PD def.).                                              |
| **CT/MRI Brain**       | **Bilateral globus pallidus lesions** (hypodense CT, T2 hyper MRI).                            | Less specific; diffuse edema or basal ganglia lesions possible.                              | Non-specific hypoxic changes if severe.                                                       |
| **O2-Myoglobin Curve** | **Shifts Left** (impairs O2 release to muscle).                                                | No direct significant effect.                                                                | No direct significant effect; O2-HGB curve shifts left for normal Hb.                         |
| **Buzzwords**          | "Faulty heater," "car exhaust," "globus pallidus lesions."                                     | "Almond breath," "plastic fire," "nitroprusside."                                            | "Dapsone," "benzocaine," "chocolate-brown blood," "saturation gap."                           |
# Management 
- Patient decontamination (e.g., remove clothes, wash skin)
- Administration of 100% oxygen regardless of saturation readings
- Supportive care
- Antidote 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hydroxocobalamin (precursor of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]]): binds cyanide directly and forms cyanocobalamin, which is excreted in urine (first-line antidote)</span>
	- Sodium nitrite, amyl nitrite, or 4-dimethylaminophenol (4-DMAP) to induce [[USMLE/Respiratory/Methemoglobinemia\|methemoglobinemia]] (via oxidation of Hb): Methemoglobin binds to cyanide to form cyanomethemoglobin, which diverts cyanide from cytochrome complex IV and increases oxidative phosphorylation.
	- Sodium thiosulfate: supplies sulfur donors to the mitochondrial enzyme rhodanese. Rhodanese detoxifies cyanide into thiocyanate, which is excreted in urine (usually coadministered with hydroxocobalamin).
