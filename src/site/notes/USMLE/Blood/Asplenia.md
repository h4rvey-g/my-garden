# Infection in asplenic patients
General
Increased risk of fulminant and life-threatening infections and sepsis for up to 30 years or longer after splenectomy
## Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) and asplenic sepsis
- Definition: a bacterial infection that rapidly progresses to fulminant, overwhelming sepsis in the setting of anatomic or functional asplenia
- Etiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">encapsulated bacteria (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Streptococcus pneumoniae\|Streptococcus pneumoniae]], Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae)</span>

- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normally, encapsulated pathogens are opsonized with antibodies & C3b and then phagocytosed by specialized macrophages in the spleen.</span>
		- Nearly half of the body's total immunoglobulins are produced by splenic B-lymphocytes. Splenic opsonizing antibody is of particular importance in the clearance of encapsulated species, as the capsule allows them to resist innate phagocytosis.![L16733.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L16733.jpg)
	- Individuals with asplenia lack these specialized macrophages, so pathogens are able to spread and cause sepsis.

>People with high susceptibility of encapsulated bacteria:
>- [[USMLE/Blood/Sickle cell disease\|Sickle cell anemia]]
>- C3 deficiency
- Clinical features: initially flu-like symptoms, followed by rapid deterioration within hours with fever, severe malaise, signs of sepsis, and [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]]
