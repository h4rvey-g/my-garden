| Feature                               | Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)                  | Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)                               |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pathophysiology**                   | Autoantibody-mediated destruction of platelets | Deficiency of ADAMTS13 enzyme leading to excessive platelet aggregation |
| **Platelet Count**                    | Usually moderately low (20,000-70,000/μL)      | Severely low (<20,000/μL)                                               |

| **Organ Involvement**                 | Limited systemic involvement                   | Widespread (brain, kidneys, heart)                                      |
| **Neurological Symptoms**             | Rare                                           | Common (confusion, headache, seizures, stroke)                          |
| **Renal Involvement**                 | Rare                                           | Common (acute kidney injury)                                            |
| **Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia** | Absent                                         | Present (schistocytes on blood smear)                                   |
| **Fever**                             | Uncommon                                       | Common                                                                  |
| **Primary Treatment**                 | Corticosteroids, IVIG, anti-D                  | Plasma exchange, rituximab                                              |
| **Mortality without Treatment**       | Low                                            | High (>90%)                                                             |
| **Age Distribution**                  | Bimodal (young adults and elderly)             | Adults (more common in women)                                           |
| **Associated Conditions**             | Autoimmune disorders                           | Pregnancy, medications, infections, cancers                             |

# Etiology
- Primary ITP: idiopathic (most common) 
- Secondary ITP associated with:
	- Autoimmune disorders: [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|SLE]], [[USMLE/MSK/Antiphospholipid syndrome\|Antiphospholipid syndrome]]
	- Malignancy: lymphoma, leukemia (particularly CLL)
	- Infection: HIV, HCV
	- Drugs: e.g., quinine, beta-lactam antibiotics, carbamazepine, heparin, vaccines, linezolid, sulfonamides, vancomycin, TMP-SMX, antiepileptics

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The acute form is typically seen in children after a viral disease.</span>
# Pathophysiology
Antiplatelet antibodies (mostly IgG directed against, e.g., GpIIb/IIIa, GpIb/IX) bind to surface proteins on platelets �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sequestration by spleen and liver</span> �?�?platelet count �?bone marrow megakaryocytes and platelet production increase in response (in most cases).
# Clinical features
- Mostly asymptomatic.<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> [[USMLE/Blood/Splenomegaly\|Splenomegaly]] is very unusual in ITP and makes other diagnoses more likely! </span>
	- Although platelets can undergo splenic sequestration in ITP, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the primary mechanism responsible for the thrombocytopenia is immune destruction.</span>
