A group of enzymes found throughout the body but produced predominantly in the liver, bones, placenta, and small intestine. Common causes of elevated serum ALP include cholestasis, bone disease (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bone metastases</span>, [[USMLE/MSK/Paget disease\|Paget's disease]], [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism\|hyperparathyroidism]]), and [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|pregnancy]]. The normal reference range is 40-120 U/L.
# Common causes of elevation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cholestasis (obstructive or nonobstructive)</span>
	- When ALP is elevated but γ-GT and AST/ALT ratio are normal, cholestasis is an unlikely cause for the ALP elevation.
- Infiltrative diseases of the liver (e.g., malignancies or [[USMLE/Pathology/Amyloidosis\|amyloidosis]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased osteoblast activity </span>
	- E.g., skeletal metastases, osteomalacia, fracture healing, [[USMLE/MSK/Paget disease\|Paget disease]], and during physiological growth periods
- Seminoma
- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]] (third trimester)
- [[USMLE/Renal/Chronic kidney disease\|Chronic kidney disease]]
# Differential Diagnosis Based on Elevated LFTs

## Hepatocellular pattern: Elevated aminotransferases out of proportion to alkaline phosphatase
- AST/ALT < 1 (AST < ALT) (Also called <font color="#ffc000">inflammatory type hepatocellular injury</font>)
	- Uncomplicated viral hepatitis
	- Minor fatty liver disease
	- Extrahepatic cholestasis
- AST/ALT ≥ 1 (AST > ALT) (Also called <font color="#ffc000">necrotic type hepatocellular injury</font>)
	- [[USMLE/GI/Alcoholic hepatitis\|Alcoholic hepatitis]]
		- Typically AST/ALT > 2
		- AST usually does not exceed 500 U/L in [[USMLE/GI/Alcoholic hepatitis\|alcoholic hepatitis]].
	- Fulminant, necrotic hepatitis
	- (Decompensated) [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]]: The AST/ALT ratio can increase as fibrosis advances.
	- [[USMLE/GI/Hepatocellular carcinoma\|Hepatocellular carcinoma]], liver metastases
	- Muscle damage 
	- Myocardial infarction
## Cholestatic pattern: Elevated alkaline phosphatase +gamma glutamyl transferase + bilirubin out of proportion to AST and ALT

- **Hepatobiliary causes**: Bile duct obstruction, [[USMLE/GI/Primary biliary cholangitis\|primary biliary cirrhosis]], [[USMLE/GI/Primary sclerosing cholangitis\|primary sclerosing cholangitis]], medication-induced, infiltrating diseases of the liver ([[USMLE/Respiratory/Sarcoidosis\|sarcoidosis]], [[USMLE/Pathology/Amyloidosis\|amyloidosis]], lymphoma, among others), [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|cystic fibrosis]], hepatic metastasis, cholestasis
- **Non-Hepatic causes**: Bone disease, [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|pregnancy]], chronic renal failure, lymphoma or other malignancies, [[congestive heart failure\|congestive heart failure]], childhood growth, infection, or inflammation

>The mechanism for an elevated alkaline phosphatase has been related to enhanced synthesis and to release from cell membranes by the detergent action of retained bile salts.
