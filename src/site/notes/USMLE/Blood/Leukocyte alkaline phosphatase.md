An enzyme <font color="#ffc000">found in mature leukocytes</font>. Staining of LAP on peripheral blood smear is used to calculate the LAP score. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A high LAP score is associated with an increased number of mature white blood cells (e.g., from leukemoid reaction or myeloproliferative disorders); a low LAP score is associated with an increased number of immature white blood cells (e.g., from [[USMLE/Blood/Chronic myeloid leukemia\|CML]]).</span>
