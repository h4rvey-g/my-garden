# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Iatrogenic</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vascular interventions</span>, e.g., percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
	- Cardiac surgery

# Pathophysiology
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|Atherosclerosis]] �?rupture of atherosclerotic plaque (most commonly from the aorta) �?blockage and inflammation of small to medium arteries by cholesterol crystals �?formation of multiple small peripheral, muscular, or visceral emboli �?end-organ damage</span>

# Clinical features

- Features of renal damage
	- Signs of [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|acute kidney injury]]
- Peripheral skin manifestations

	- Necrosis
	- Purpura
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blue toe syndrome: ischemia due to small vessel occlusion that manifests as toe discoloration (pulses typically remain palpable as large arteries are unaffected)</span>
- Signs of gastrointestinal involvement (e.g., intestinal ischemia or pancreatitis)
- Signs of CNS involvement (e.g., [[USMLE/Neurology/Ischemic stroke\|ischemic stroke]] or TIA)
- Signs of retinal involvement
	- Hollenhorst plaques on retinal exam
	- Amaurosis fugax

# Diagnostics

- Biopsy 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amorphous, eosinophilic material in the vessel lumen</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spindle-shaped spaces (cholesterol clefts)</span>, formed when the fat molecules in cholesterol emboli dissolve during sample processing![Pasted image 20250530100430.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250530100430.png)
