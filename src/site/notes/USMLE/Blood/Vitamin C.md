# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
severe malnutrition (e.g., due to alcoholism, illicit drug use, and/or psychiatric illness)

---
# Pathophysiology
## Vitamin C functions
- Hydrophilic antioxidant
- Conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine: coenzyme in dopamine β-hydroxylase
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]] synthesis: coenzyme in hydroxylation reaction of proline and lysine</span>![L13176.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L13176.jpg)
- Facilitates iron [[USMLE/GI/Absorption\|absorption]] (keeps iron in Fe2+ reduced state)

# Clinical features
- Scurvy: clinical manifestation of vitamin C deficiency, which leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]] synthesis and easily damaged connective tissue</span>

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of anemia (fatigue, paleness)</span>
		- Normocytic anemia: decreased iron absorption in the small intestine
		- Macrocytic anemia: decreased conversion of folate into its active metabolite
- Poor immune response
>[!tip] 
>Suspect scurvy when the patient is malnourished, with symptoms of corkscrew hair, bleeding, anemia.
