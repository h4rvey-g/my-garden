# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|Atherosclerosis]] in the aorta and peripheral arteries</span> → insufficient tissue perfusion → PAD
- PAD usually coexists with [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|coronary artery disease]]. Smoking is one of the most important risk factors for PAD!

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
- Intermittent claudication
	- Femoropopliteal disease (most common): typically causes calf claudication 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aortoiliac disease (Leriche syndrome)</span>
		- Level of the aortic bifurcation or bilateral occlusion of the iliac arteries
		- Triad of bilateral buttock, hip, or thigh claudication, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">erectile dysfunction</span>, and absent/diminished femoral pulses
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Worsens upon exertion</span>
		- Due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased oxygen demand</span>

# Treatment
---
## Vasodilator therapy
- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intermittent claudication</span> to improve symptoms and functional status
	- May be considered after revascularization of femoropopliteal disease to reduce the risk of re-stenosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agent: [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Phosphodiesterase inhibitors\|cilostazol]] (a phosphodiesterase type 3 inhibitor with vasodilatory, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antiplatelet agents\|antiplatelet]], and antithrombotic properties)</span>
