# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Pathogen
	- Group A β‑hemolytic streptococci ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Streptococcus pyogenes\|Streptococcus pyogenes]]) produce erythrogenic exotoxin A, B, or C
		- These exotoxins cause the rash of scarlet fever via a delayed-type skin reaction.
- Route of transmission: aerosol

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
## Exanthem phase
- Rash manifests 12–48 hours after fever onset.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fine, erythematous, sandpaper‑like texture </span>![02be34c0674be59ca5d5c1fd12cb691f.webp](/img/user/appendix/02be34c0674be59ca5d5c1fd12cb691f.webp)
- Blanches with pressure, but nonblanching petechiae may also be present
- Begins on neck or trunk and spreads rapidly across the body (except for the palms and soles)
- Characteristic features include:
	- Flushed cheeks with perioral pallor  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strawberry tongue</span>: bright red tongue color with papillary hyperplasia, which may initially be covered with a white coating 
	- Pastia lines
		- A characteristic sign of scarlet fever
		- Linear, petechial appearance
		- Most pronounced in the groin, underarm, and elbow creases (i.e., flexural areas)

# Diagnostics

| Feature             | Scarlet Fever                            | Acute Rheumatic Fever                                                  |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Timing**          | **Concurrent** with active GAS infection | **Delayed** (2–4 weeks post-infection)                                 |
| **Pathophysiology** | **Toxin-mediated** (SPEs)                | **Immune-mediated** (molecular mimicry)                                |
| **Rash**            | "Sandpaper" texture, diffuse, punctate   | Erythema marginatum (serpiginous, clear centers)                       |
| **Key Finding**     | Strawberry tongue, Pastia's lines        | Migratory polyarthritis, carditis, chorea                              |
| **Treatment Goal**  | Eradicate active infection, prevent ARF  | Reduce inflammation, **prevent recurrence** with long-term prophylaxis |

# Treatment
- Initiate one of the recommended antibiotic regimens for acute GAS pharyngitis, e.g.: 
	- Oral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">penicillin V</span> or amoxicillin
	- Nonsevere penicillin reaction: oral cephalosporins (e.g., cephalexin)
	- Severe penicillin reaction: oral macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) or clindamycin
