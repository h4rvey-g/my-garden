Sjogren syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that most commonly occurs in middle-aged women.
# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Primary Sjogren syndrome: idiopathic (association with HLA-DR52) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary Sjogren syndrome: associated with another autoimmune disease</span>, e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis\|rheumatoid arthritis]], [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[USMLE/MSK/Systemic sclerosis\|systemic sclerosis]], [[USMLE/MSK/Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\|polymyositis]], or [[USMLE/GI/Primary biliary cholangitis\|primary biliary cirrhosis]]

## Sicca syndrome
- Ocular symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Xerophthalmia: dry eyes due to decreased secretion of tears (daily, persistent)</span>
	- Keratoconjunctivitis sicca
		- Conjunctival injection
		- Eye itching or burning sensation
		- Recurrent sensation of sand or a foreign body in the eyes
- Oral symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Xerostomia: dry mouth due to decreased secretion of saliva (daily, persistent) which may lead to: </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dental caries and oral infections </span>
		- Parotid gland enlargement, often bilateral
		- Tongue fissures
# Diagnostics
---
- **Serology:**
	- **Anti-Ro (SSA) and Anti-La (SSB) antibodies:** Highly specific, especially anti-La.
	- **Antinuclear Antibody (ANA):** Positive in >95% of cases, making it a sensitive but non-specific test.
	- **Rheumatoid Factor (RF):** Often positive even without concomitant RA.
- **Ophthalmologic Tests:**
	- **Schirmer test:** Measures tear production by placing filter paper in the lower eyelid; <5 mm of wetting in 5 minutes is abnormal.
	- **Rose bengal stain:** Stains devitalized cornea and conjunctiva, revealing damage from dryness.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Biopsy:** **Lip (minor salivary gland) biopsy** is the most accurate test, showing focal lymphocytic infiltration.</span>

# Complications
---
- Development of associated conditions
	- Autoimmune diseases, e.g., [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[USMLE/MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis\|rheumatoid arthritis]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B-cell lymphomas, e.g., [[USMLE/GI/MALT lymphoma\|MALT lymphoma]]</span>
		- Prevalence âˆ¼ 5% 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Frequently manifests as unilateral, persistent parotid enlargement</span>
		- Predictors of lymphoma include lymphadenopathy, palpable purpura, and cryoglobulinemia.
	- [[USMLE/Renal/Renal tubular disorders\|Renal tubular acidosis]] type 1 
- Corneal scarring, ulcer, rupture, and infection
- Pregnancy: fetal loss, infant with neonatal lupus syndrome and associated complete heart block
