# Pathophysiology/Etiology

- Myopia is a refractive error where light focuses _in front_ of the retina instead of directly on it, causing distant objects to appear blurry.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Axial Myopia (most common):** The eyeball has an excessive axial length (it's too long).</span> A 1 mm increase in length equals about a -3 diopter (D) change.
- **Refractive Myopia:** The refractive power of the cornea or lens is too strong for the eye's axial length.
- **Etiology:** A combination of genetic predisposition (high heritability) and environmental factors (e.g., prolonged near-work, less time spent outdoors).
