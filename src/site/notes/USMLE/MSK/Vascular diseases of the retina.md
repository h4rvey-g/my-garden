# Retinopathy of prematurity
---
- Definition: disease of the retina with abnormal vessel proliferations that affects preterm infants
- Pathophysiology: hypoxic in utero environment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preterm birth → elevated and fluctuating partial pressures of oxygen (especially if supplemental oxygen is given for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome) → ↓ VEGF → arrest of normal angiogenesis → maturation and hypoxia of the avascular retina → ↑ VEGF → retinal neovascularization and possibly pathological extraretinal neovascularization</span> → hemorrhages, formation of fibrovascular membranes, and, in severe cases, retinal detachment![highresdefault_L79418.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L79418.jpg)
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Premature birth</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ventilation or oxygen administration</span>
	- Birth weight < 1500 g
