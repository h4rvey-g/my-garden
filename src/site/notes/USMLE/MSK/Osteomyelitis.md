# Epidemiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous osteomyelitis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">More common in children and adolescents</span>
	- Incidence is increasing in adults, driven by a rise in vertebral osteomyelitis
- Exogenous osteomyelitis: more common in adults

# Etiology
---
## Routes of infection 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous osteomyelitis</span> (endogenous osteomyelitis): caused by hematogenous dissemination of a pathogen
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exogenous osteomyelitis</span>: caused by a spread of bacteria (typically multiple pathogens) from the surrounding environment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Posttraumatic</span>: infection following deep injury (penetrating injury, open fractures, severe soft tissue injury)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contiguous</span>: spread of infection from adjacent tissue
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary to infected foot ulcer in patients with [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]]</span>
		- Iatrogenic (e.g., postoperative infection of a prosthetic joint implant)
## Pathogen
### <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus\|Staphylococcus aureus]] (most common cause)</span>
- Children and adults
- Individuals that recreationally use IV drugs
- Patients with vertebral lesions
- Patients with prosthetics
- Diabetic patients with foot ulcers and pressure ulcers
### Staphylococcus epidermidis
- Patients with prosthetics
### Streptococci
- Diabetic patients with foot ulcers and pressure ulcers
- Neonates and infants
### [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pseudomonas\|Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
- Persons who inject drugs
- Plantar puncture wounds (especially if wearing rubber-soled footwear)
### Enterobacteriaceae
- Salmonella
	- Patients with [[USMLE/Blood/Sickle cell disease\|sickle cell anemia]]
- Klebsiella
	- Patients with [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary tract infections\|UTIs]]
### Mycobacterium [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]]
- See "Tuberculous [[USMLE/MSK/Spinal infections\|spondylitis]]" (Pott disease)
### Pasteurella multocida
- Bites from dogs and cats
### Fungi (e.g., Candida)
- Immunocompromised patients
- Individuals that recreationally use IV drugs

# Diagnostics
---
## Imaging
- X-ray: low sensitivity and specificity for osteomyelitis
	- Indication: initial evaluation as can also exclude differential diagnoses of osteomyelitis
	- Characteristic findings
		- Acute osteomyelitis: typically no pathological findings
		- Subacute/chronic osteomyelitis: bone destruction, sequestrum formation, periosteal reactions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MRI with and without IV gadolinium: most sensitive study</span>
	- Indications
		- Suspected acute osteomyelitis (evidence of inflammation can be seen â‰¤ 5 days after onset of infection)
	- Characteristic findings 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute/subacute osteomyelitis: cortical destruction, bone marrow inflammation, soft-tissue involvement </span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Focal hyperperfusion and increased radiotracer uptake within the affected region.</span>
		- Chronic osteomyelitis: fibrotic scarring of the marrow
