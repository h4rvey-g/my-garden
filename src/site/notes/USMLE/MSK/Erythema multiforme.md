# Etiology
---
Erythema multiforme is a [[USMLE/Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction\|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] which can be triggered by the following.
- Infections (most common): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">herpes simplex virus ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]) (50% of cases), Mycoplasma pneumoniae</span>, and fungal infections 
- Drugs: e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]], beta-lactam [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|antibiotics]] (e.g., penicillins), and sulfonamides

# Pathophysiology
---
1. **Trigger Exposure:** The process begins with exposure to a trigger (most often HSV).
2. **Viral DNA Transport:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In herpes-associated EM, viral DNA fragments are transported to the skin by peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</span>
3. **Keratinocyte Expression:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HSV genes within these fragments are expressed by keratinocytes (skin cells).</span>
4. **Immune Cell Recruitment:** This expression <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">attracts HSV-specific CD4+ T helper cells</span> to the area.
5. **Inflammatory Cascade:** The CD4+ cells react to the viral antigens, releasing interferon-gamma, which starts an inflammatory cascade. This immune response damages the skin cells, leading to the characteristic lesions.

# Clinical features
---
- Rash
	- Acute onset, with progression from erythematous macules to papules and vesicles to target lesions 
	- Target lesions
		- Characteristic of EM, appear a few days after the onset of rash, may be absent in some patients
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Target lesions have 3 zones: an inner dark red/brown zone, surrounded by a pale zone, and an outer erythematous ring</span> ![L11013.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L11013.jpg)
		1. **Inner Dark Red/Brown Zone (Central Dusky Zone):**
		    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This central zone represents the area of greatest epidermal damage.</span>
		    - It is characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">epidermal necrosis (cell death) of keratinocytes.</span>
		    - There may be blister formation in this zone.
		    - Histologically, you might see vacuolization (formation of small cavities) in the basal cell layer of the epidermis.
		2. **Pale Zone (Middle Edematous Zone):**
		    - This zone surrounds the central dusky area.
		    - It is lighter in color and is characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">edema</span> in the dermis (the layer of skin below the epidermis).
		    - The edema is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">due to increased vascular permeability</span>, which allows fluid to leak out of blood vessels into the surrounding tissue.
		3. **Outer Erythematous Ring (Peripheral Red Ring):**
		    - This is the outermost zone and has a red, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inflamed appearance</span>.
		    - This area involves:
		        - Perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate: Immune cells (lymphocytes and monocytes) accumulate around blood vessels.
		        - Increased number of epidermal Langerhans cells (immune cells in the skin) and CD4+ T cell infiltration are observed.
		        - Expression of ICAM-1 and HLA-DR antigens on keratinocytes.
		    - The erythematous (red) color is because of vasodilation (widening of blood vessels) and increased blood flow in the area, which is a typical sign of inflammation.
		    - A study found that histamine metabolism can be impaired in the lesion. The activity of histamine-N-methyltransferase was significantly decreased in this area.
