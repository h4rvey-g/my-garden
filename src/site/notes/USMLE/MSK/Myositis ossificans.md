<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Myositis ossificans (heterotopic ossification) is a benign, heterotopic ossification of soft tissue and/or skeletal muscle that either occurs </span>congenitally or, more commonly, following soft tissue or muscle injury
- Etiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Posttraumatic: especially after implantation of an artificial hip joint or after blunt muscle trauma</span>
		- Trauma initiates the expression of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bone morphogenic proteins</span>, which promote in-migration of spindle stem cells.  These cells differentiate to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fibroblasts</span> (which produce collagen and extracellular matrix) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">subsequently to chondrocytes and osteoblasts (which are responsible for production of osteoid and mineralization).</span>
- Clinical features: localized symptoms in the affected muscle/tissue (e.g., quadriceps femoris muscle, brachialis muscle)
	- Restriction of movement
	- Muscle stiffness
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pain, swelling</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpable soft tissue mass</span>
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Soft tissue ossification is detectable on conventional x-ray.</span>![L62288.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L62288.jpg)
	- Radiological findings: periosteal reaction with periarticular soft tissue calcifications (eggshell calcification)
	- Laboratory findings: â†‘ [[USMLE/Blood/Alkaline phosphatase\|alkaline phosphatase]] and ESR levels
