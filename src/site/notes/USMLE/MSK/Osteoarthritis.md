# Differential diagnosis
---
- Traditionally, osteoarthritis (OA) has been classified as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">non-inflammatory or "wear-and-tear" arthritis</span>
	- The inflammation is generally less pronounced
	- It <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">doesn't typically feature systemic inflammation markers</span>
	- It <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">doesn't involve autoimmune mechanisms as its primary cause</span>
	- Morning stiffness is typically shorter in duration

# Treatment
## Approach
Follow a stepwise approach to treatment: Start with nonpharmacological management, followed by pharmacological and/or surgical treatment if needed.
- Nonpharmacological management: e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">exercise and weight loss</span>
- Pharmacotherapy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First line: e.g., topical or oral NSAIDs</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Second line: e.g., [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|acetaminophen]] or intraarticular glucocorticoid injections</span>
- Surgical management: e.g., complete or partial joint replacement (arthroplasty) using an endoprosthesis
>[!tip] 
>Pharmacotherapy should only be used as a short-term treatment in symptomatic patients; long-term therapy is associated with many adverse effects.
