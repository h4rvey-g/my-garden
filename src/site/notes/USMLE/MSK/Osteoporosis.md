# Epidemiology

# Etiology
## Primary osteoporosis (most common)
- Type I (postmenopausal osteoporosis): postmenopausal women 
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Estrogen]] stimulates [[USMLE/MSK/Bone remodeling\|osteoblasts]] and inhibits [[USMLE/MSK/Bone remodeling\|osteoclasts]].
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The decreased [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|estrogen]] levels following [[USMLE/Reproductive/Menopause\|menopause]] lead to increased bone resorption.</span>
- Type II (senile osteoporosis): gradual loss of bone mass as patients age (especially > 70 years)
## Secondary osteoporosis
- Drug induced
	- Most commonly due to systemic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-term therapy with corticosteroids</span> (e.g., in patients with autoimmune disease)

| [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|Anticonvulsants]] that induce [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|cytochrome P450]] (phenobarbital, phenytoin, [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|carbamazepine]]) | ↑ [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin D\|Vitamin D]] catabolism |

| Medroxyprogesterone                                                                                                                           | ↓ Testosterone & estrogen  |

## Additional risk factors
- Cigarette smoking
- Immobilization or inadequate physical activity
- [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|Malabsorption]] (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Celiac disease\|celiac disease]]), malnutrition (e.g., diet low in calcium and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin D\|vitamin D]]), anorexia

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary osteoporosis: Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are usually normal</span>

# Treatment
## Bisphosphonates
- Alendronate, Risedronate, Ibandronate, Zoledronic acid
- Indications: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preferred initial treatment in all patients</span>
- See [[USMLE/MSK/Paget disease#Bisphosphonates\|Paget disease#Bisphosphonates]] for details
## Nonbisphosphonates
### Denosumab
- Mechanism of action
	- Monoclonal antibody <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">against the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)</span>
	- Targets RANKL by mimicking osteoprotegerin → interference in osteoclast maturation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ osteoclast activity</span>
### PTH and [[USMLE/Renal/Parathyroid hormone-related protein\|PTH-related protein]] analogues
- Teriparatide, Abaloparatide
- Recombinant human parathyroid hormone that increases osteoblastic activity → increased bone growth
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulsatile PTH secretion has an anabolic effect on bone metabolism, stimulating osteoblast proliferation, decreasing osteoblast apoptosis, and inducing increased formation of new bone.</span>  Recombinant PTH analogues (eg, teriparatide) are used to treat severe osteoporosis; these analogues promote [[USMLE/MSK/Bone remodeling\|bone remodeling]] by inducing increased resorption of old bone while stimulating a corresponding increase in new bone production, resulting in a net increase in total bone mass (ie, positive bone balance).
	- Also increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption & renal tubular calcium reabsorption
