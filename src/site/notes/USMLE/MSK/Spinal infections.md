# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
## Routes of infection
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous spread from a distant focus (e.g., skin and soft tissue infection, urinary tract infection)</span>
- Direct inoculation (e.g., during spinal surgery or due to trauma)
- Contiguous spread from adjacent infections (e.g., aorta, esophagus)
## Pathogens
- Common
	- [[USMLE/Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus\|Staphylococcus aureus]] (most common, accounting for > 40% of cases)
	- Escherichia coli (second most common)
## Risk factors
- Age > 50 years 
- [[USMLE/Blood/Sickle cell disease\|Sickle cell disease]] 
- Immunocompromise: e.g., steroid use, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]] infection
- Intravenous drug use
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recent bacteremia</span>
- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Infective endocarditis\|Infective endocarditis]]
- Recent spinal surgery and instrumentation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intravascular devices</span>
- Malnutrition
- Chronic medical conditions:

## Imaging studies
### <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MRI spine</span> 
- Indication: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">first-line</span> imaging modality for suspected spinal infection (highest sensitivity)
- Modality: MRI spine with and without IV gadolinium contrast
