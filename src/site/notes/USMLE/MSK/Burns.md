# Burn Surface Area and Fluid Replacement
## 1. Estimating Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) Burned
![fbd8da5bf1713ba5d7af8ab6a474cf7.jpg](/img/user/appendix/fbd8da5bf1713ba5d7af8ab6a474cf7.jpg)

*   **Rule of Nines (Adults):** A quick method to estimate TBSA for partial and full-thickness burns.
    *   **Head & Neck:** 9%
    *   **Each Arm:** 9%
    *   **Anterior Torso:** 18%
    *   **Posterior Torso:** 18%
    *   **Each Leg:** 18%
    *   **Genitalia/Perineum:** 1%

*   **Rule of Nines (Pediatric):** Modified due to different body proportions (larger head, smaller legs).
    *   **Head & Neck:** 18%
    *   **Each Arm:** 9%
    *   **Anterior Torso:** 18%
    *   **Posterior Torso:** 18%
    *   **Each Leg:** 14%

*   **Lund-Browder Chart:** More accurate, especially for children, as it adjusts for age.

*   **Palmar Method:** The surface area of the patient's palm (including fingers) is roughly 1% of their TBSA, useful for smaller, patchy burns.

**Important Note:** Only partial-thickness (2nd degree) and full-thickness (3rd degree) burns are included in the TBSA calculation for fluid resuscitation. Superficial (1st degree) burns like simple erythema are excluded.

## 2. Fluid Resuscitation

Intravenous fluid resuscitation is crucial for patients with significant burns to prevent burn shock.

*   **Indications:** Generally required for burns >20% TBSA in adults and >10-15% TBSA in children.

*   **Parkland Formula:** The most widely used formula to calculate fluid requirements for the first 24 hours post-burn.
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Formula:** **4 mL x Body Weight (kg) x %TBSA**</span>
        *   Some sources may mention a modified Brooke formula using 2 mL/kg/%TBSA.
        *   For children, 3 mL/kg/%TBSA is often recommended.

*   **Fluid Administration Schedule:**
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**First 8 hours:** Give the **first half** of the total calculated volume.</span>
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Next 16 hours:** Give the **second half** of the total volume.</span>
    *   **Key Point:** The "first 8 hours" starts from the **time of the burn injury**, not from the time of hospital arrival.

*   **Choice of Fluid:**
    *   **Lactated Ringer's (LR)** is the preferred crystalloid solution due to its physiologic composition.
    *   Normal saline can also be used.

## 3. Monitoring and Titration

The Parkland formula is an initial estimate. Fluid rates must be titrated based on the patient's response.

*   **Primary Indicator:** Urine output (UOP) is the most reliable indicator of adequate resuscitation. An indwelling urinary catheter is essential for accurate monitoring.
*   **Target UOP:**
    *   **Adults:** 0.5 - 1.0 mL/kg/hr (commonly 30-50 mL/hr).
    *   **Children (<30 kg):** 1.0 mL/kg/hr.
*   **Other Monitoring Parameters:**
    *   Mental status, heart rate, blood pressure, and palpable peripheral pulses are also important indicators of adequate perfusion.

*   **Special Considerations:**
    *   **Pediatric Patients:** In addition to resuscitation fluids, children also require maintenance fluids, often containing dextrose.
    *   **Inhalational Injury:** Patients with inhalation injury often have significantly increased fluid requirements.
    *   **Electrical Burns:** High-voltage electrical burns can cause extensive deep tissue damage not apparent on the surface, leading to higher fluid needs.
