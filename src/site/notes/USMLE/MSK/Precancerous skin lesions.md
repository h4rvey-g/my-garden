# Actinic keratosis
---
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UV-induced precancerous skin lesion</span> that may progress to skin cancer.
- Epidemiology: occurs especially in individuals with light skin who are over the age of 50
- Etiology: sun exposure (e.g., from working outdoors)
- Lesion
	- Occurs on areas of sun-exposed skin 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initially: small lesion (papule or plaque) with rough surface (sandpaper-like texture)</span>
	- Later: Lesions grow and become brown or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">erythematous and scaly</span>.![L12529.png](/img/user/appendix/L12529.png)
	- Hyperkeratosis in such lesions may become prominent and form <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cutaneous horns</span>.![L11311.png](/img/user/appendix/L11311.png)
- Prognosis
	- Lesions may either regress, persist, or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">progress to [[USMLE/MSK/Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\|cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma]] (SCC). </span>
	- The degree of epithelial dysplasia determines the risk of [[USMLE/MSK/Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma\|cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma]].
