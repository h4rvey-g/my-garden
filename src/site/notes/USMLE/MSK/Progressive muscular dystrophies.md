# Epidemiology
---
- Sex: only male individuals affected in DMD and BMD 
- Age of onset
	- DMD: 2–5 years
	- BMD: adolescence or early adulthood, usually > 15 years

# Etiology
---
- Inheritance pattern (DMD and BMD): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X-linked recessive</span>
- Chromosomal mutations affecting the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dystrophin gene</span> on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp21)
	- DMD: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">frameshift deletion</span> or nonsense mutation → shortened or absent dystrophin protein
	- BMD: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in-frame deletion</span> → partially functional dystrophin protein
	- In about two-thirds of DMD or BMD cases, deleted segments are as large as one or more exons.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dystrophin protein: anchors the [[USMLE/Pathology/Cytoskeleton\|cytoskeleton]] of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells to the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|extracellular matrix]] by connecting cytoskeletal actin filaments to membrane-bound α- and β-dystroglycan, which are connected to extracellular laminin</span>![Pasted image 20241130100905.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241130100905.png)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dystrophin gene: largest known protein-coding gene in the human DNA</span>
	- Because of its size, the dystrophin gene is at increased risk for spontaneous mutations.
	- Mutations affecting the dystrophin gene→ alterations of dystrophin protein structure → partial (BMD) or almost complete (DMD) impairment of protein function → disturbance of numerous cellular signaling pathways → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">necrosis of affected muscle cells → replacement with connective tissue and fatty tissue → affected muscles are weak even though they appear larger (“pseudohypertrophy”)</span>
	- Errors in splicing in the DMD gene can also cause DMD.

# Clinical features
---
## Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progressive muscle paresis and atrophy</span>
	- Starts in the proximal lower limbs (pelvic girdle)
	- Extends to the upper body and distal limbs as the disease progresses
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weak reflexes</span>
- Waddling [[USMLE/Neurology/Gait\|gait]] (i.e., Duchenne limp) with bilateral [[USMLE/MSK/Trendelenburg sign\|Trendelenburg sign]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gower maneuver</span>
	- The individual arrives at a standing position by supporting themselves on their thighs and then using the hands to “walk up” the body until they are upright. ![Pasted image 20240402223808.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240402223808.png)
	- Classic sign of DMD, but also occurs in inflammatory myopathies (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\|dermatomyositis]], [[USMLE/MSK/Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\|polymyositis]]) and other muscular dystrophies (e.g., BMD)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Calf pseudohypertrophy</span>
	- Mutations affecting the dystrophin gene→ alterations of dystrophin protein structure → partial (BMD) or almost complete (DMD) impairment of protein function → disturbance of numerous cellular signaling pathways → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">necrosis of affected muscle cells → replacement with connective tissue and fatty tissue → affected muscles are weak even though they appear larger</span> (“pseudohypertrophy”)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vs [[USMLE/Neurology/Polyneuropathy\|Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]], which has calf atrophy</span>
## Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) 
- Symptoms similar to those of DMD, but less severe
- Slower progression (patients often remain ambulatory into adult life)
