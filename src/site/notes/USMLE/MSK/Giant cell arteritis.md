# Epidemiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peak incidence: 70–79 years (rarely seen in patients &lt 50 years)</span>

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Association with [[USMLE/MSK/Polymyalgia rheumatica\|polymyalgia rheumatica]]</span> (PMR): up to 50% of patients with giant cell arteritis also have PMR.

# Pathophysiology
---
- Monocytes differentiate into macrophages and giant cells, which produce cytokines (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IL-6, [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor\|TNF-α]]</span>) that augment the inflammatory response → focal [[USMLE/Immunology/Granulomatous inflammation\|granulomatous inflammation]]
- Most commonly involves <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">external carotid artery branches (especially temporal artery)</span>, as well as the aorta and vertebral arteries

# Clinical features
---
- Cranial giant cell arteritis: involves the extracranial branches of the common carotid, internal carotid, and external carotid arteries (the temporal artery is the most commonly affected vessel)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">New-onset unilateral (or bilateral) headache</span>
		- Can be pulse-synchronous, throbbing, dull
		- Typically located <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">over the temples</span>
	- Hardened and tender temporal artery ![Pasted image 20240403193138.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240403193138.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Craniofacial pain syndromes: Jaw claudication, tongue claudication, and facial pain may occur.  This tends to appear during mastication (chewing) when the blood supply to the corresponding areas does not increase normally due to the narrowing of the arterial lumens.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden vision loss: due to inflammation and occlusion of the ophthalmic artery and its branches</span>
		- Scintillating scotoma
		- Amaurosis fugax or permanent loss of vision due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms of [[USMLE/MSK/Polymyalgia rheumatica\|polymyalgia rheumatica]], e.g. muscle pain primarily affecting shoulders, neck, and pelvic girdle</span>

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</span> & C-reactive protein <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(best initial test)</span>
	- Highly sensitive and almost always significantly elevated in GCA.
- Temporal artery biopsy: intimal thickening, elastic lamina fragmentation, multinucleated giant cells

# Treatment
---
- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|Glucocorticoid]] therapy
- Adjunctive therapy
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antagonist)</span>
