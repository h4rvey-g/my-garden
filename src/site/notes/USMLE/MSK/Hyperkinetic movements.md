# Hyperkinetic Movements

- **Myoclonus**  
	- Rapid, brief, jerky movements that usually impact multiple different muscles (e.g., hiccups, hypnic jerks).  
	- **Seen in**: [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|Epilepsy]], metabolic disorders (e.g., renal/hepatic failure), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s), or post-hypoxic states.

- **Tics**  
	- Very brief movements that are not rhythmic.  
	- Usually the same movement each time (e.g., blinking, head-turning).  
	- **Seen in**: [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Tourette syndrome\|Tourette syndrome]], transient tic disorder, or neurodevelopmental disorders.

- **[[USMLE/Neurology/Tremor\|Tremor]]**  
	- Rhythmic oscillation.  
	- Characterized based on occurrence during action or rest.  
	- **Seen in**: [[USMLE/Neurology/Essential tremor\|Essential tremor]], Parkinson’s disease, [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]], or anxiety.

- **Chorea**  
	- Jerky movements that flow between muscle groups (i.e., dance-like).  
	- Often incorporated into voluntary movements.  
	- **Seen in**: Huntington’s disease, Sydenham’s chorea ([[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute rheumatic fever\|rheumatic fever]]), or Wilson’s disease.

- **[[USMLE/Neurology/Dystonia\|Dystonia]]**  
	- Sustained muscle contraction resulting in abnormal posture.  
	- Focal (e.g., cervical [[USMLE/Neurology/Dystonia\|dystonia]]) or generalized (e.g., [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|tardive dyskinesia]]).
	- Sensory tricks to alleviate symptoms
	- **Seen in**: Genetic dystonias (e.g., DYT1), [[USMLE/Neurology/Parkinson disease\|Parkinson disease]], or [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|tardive dyskinesia]] ([[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotic]]-induced).

- **<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemiballism</span>**  
	- Large-amplitude, unilateral, flinging movements. Like throwing something away![Pasted image 20250707173508.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250707173508.png)
	- **Seen in**: Stroke (contralateral subthalamic nucleus lesion), hyperglycemia, or infections (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]]).
