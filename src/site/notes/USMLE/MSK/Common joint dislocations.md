# Shoulder (Glenohumeral) Dislocation

-   **Patho/Etiology**
    -   Most commonly dislocated major joint due to the shallow glenoid fossa.
    -   **Anterior (>95%):** Most common type. Caused by a blow to an **abducted, externally rotated, and extended arm** (e.g., throwing a football, blocking a shot).
    -   **Posterior (2-4%):** Often missed. Classic causes are **seizures**, electrocution, or a direct blow to the anterior shoulder.

-   **Clinical Presentation**
    -   **Anterior:** Arm is held in **slight abduction and external rotation**. The acromion appears prominent, with a "squared-off" or flattened deltoid contour.
    -   **Posterior:** Arm is held in **adduction and internal rotation**. The anterior shoulder appears flattened with a prominent coracoid process.

-   **Diagnosis**
    -   **X-ray (AP and axillary/scapular "Y" views):** Confirms the direction of dislocation.
    -   **Anterior Dislocation Associated Lesions:**
        -   **Hill-Sachs lesion:** Compression fracture of the posterolateral humeral head.
        -   **Bankart lesion:** Avulsion of the anteroinferior glenoid labrum.

-   **Management**
    -   **Immediate closed reduction** after neurovascular exam and pre-reduction X-rays (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hippocratic technique</span>).![Pasted image 20250718100204.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250718100204.png)
    -   Immobilization (sling) followed by physical therapy.
    -   Surgery may be needed for recurrent dislocations, especially in young athletes.

-   **Key Complications**
    -   **Axillary nerve injury (most common):** Presents with deltoid weakness (impaired abduction) and loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder ("regimental badge" area). Often transient and resolves with reduction.
    -   **Rotator cuff tear:** More common in older patients.
    -   **Recurrent dislocation:** Common, especially in younger, active individuals.

# Hip Dislocation

-   **Patho/Etiology**
    -   Requires significant force; often from **motor vehicle accidents (dashboard injury)** or falls from a height.
    -   **Posterior (>90%):** Femoral head is forced posteriorly out of the acetabulum.
    -   **Anterior (<10%):** Usually from forced abduction.

-   **Clinical Presentation**
    -   **Posterior:** The affected limb is **shortened, adducted, and internally rotated**. This is the classic, high-yield presentation.
    -   **Anterior:** Limb is abducted and externally rotated.

-   **Diagnosis**
    -   **X-ray (AP pelvis):** Confirms diagnosis. In posterior dislocation, the femoral head appears smaller than the contralateral side. A CT scan is often done post-reduction to check for associated fractures.

-   **Management**
    -   **Orthopedic emergency.**
    -   **Prompt closed reduction** under sedation to decrease the risk of avascular necrosis (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allis technique</span>).![Pasted image 20250718100310.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250718100310.png)
    -   Open reduction if closed reduction fails or if there are associated fractures.

-   **Key Complications**
    -   **Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head:** The most serious complication; risk increases with time to reduction.
    -   **Sciatic nerve injury:** Common with posterior dislocations, presenting with foot drop (impaired dorsiflexion).
    -   **Post-traumatic arthritis:** The most common long-term complication.

# Elbow Dislocation

-   **Patho/Etiology**
    -   Second most common major joint dislocation in adults; most common in children.
    -   Usually caused by a **fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH)** with the elbow in extension.
    -   **Posterior dislocation** is the most common type.

-   **Clinical Presentation**
    -   Presents with severe pain, swelling, and inability to bend the elbow. The olecranon is prominent posteriorly.

-   **Diagnosis**
    -   **X-ray (AP and lateral):** Confirms dislocation. Important to assess for associated fractures.
    -   **"Terrible triad" of the elbow:** A complex dislocation involving a posterior dislocation, a radial head fracture, and a coronoid process fracture.

-   **Management**
    -   **Immediate closed reduction** after a careful neurovascular exam.
    -   Post-reduction, the elbow is splinted in flexion (around 90 degrees). Early range of motion is crucial to prevent stiffness.

-   **Key Complications**
    -   **Neurovascular injury:**
        -   **Brachial artery injury:** Can be limb-threatening. Always check for distal pulses before and after reduction.
        -   **Median and ulnar nerve injuries** are also common.
    -   **Compartment syndrome:** A risk, especially with associated fractures.
    -   **Contracture/Stiffness:** Loss of terminal extension is a very common long-term complication.

# Knee (Tibiofemoral) Dislocation

-   **Patho/Etiology**
    -   A rare but limb-threatening orthopedic emergency, often from high-energy trauma (MVA, falls).
    -   Can occur with lower energy in morbidly obese individuals.
    -   Up to 50% of knee dislocations spontaneously reduce before evaluation, so a high index of suspicion is required.

-   **Clinical Presentation**
    -   Gross deformity and instability of the knee. If reduced, may present with significant swelling and multi-ligamentous instability.

-   **Diagnosis**
    -   Based on clinical suspicion, even if the joint is reduced.
    -   **Ankle-brachial index (ABI):** A crucial screening tool. An ABI <0.9 warrants further vascular imaging.
    -   **CT angiography:** To rule out vascular injury.

-   **Management**
    -   **Immediate reduction.** Do not delay for imaging if there are signs of vascular compromise.
    -   Careful and repeated neurovascular checks are critical.
    -   Admission for observation and serial exams is standard.

-   **Key Complications**
    -   **Popliteal artery injury (up to 40%):** High risk of amputation if not recognized and treated promptly (within 8 hours). This is the most feared complication.
    -   **Common peroneal (fibular) nerve injury:** Presents with foot drop and numbness on the dorsum of the foot.
    -   **Multiple ligament tears (ACL, PCL, etc.):** Nearly always present and require surgical reconstruction.
