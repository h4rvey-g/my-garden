All 4 muscles of mastication are innervated by V3:
1. Temporalis â€“ elevation & retraction
2. Masseter - elevation
3. Medial pterygoid - elevation
4. Lateral pterygoid - protrusion
## TMJ disorders etiology
The etiology of TMJ disorders (TMDs) is likely multifactorial and involves:
- Behavioral factors: e.g., poor head and/or cervical spine posture, possibly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bruxism</span> 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3).</span>![L26019.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L26019.jpg)
- Psychological factors: e.g., depression, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">anxiety, stress</span>
- Trauma to the TMJ: e.g., cervical spine or jaw injuries
