| **Cause**          | [[USMLE/Infective disease/Parvovirus B19\|Parvovirus B19]] infection                                                                                                                                                          | Primarily associated with [[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute rheumatic fever\|acute rheumatic fever]] (following streptococcal [[USMLE/Infective disease/Acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis\|pharyngitis]]), but can also be seen in hereditary [[USMLE/Immunology/Angioedema\|angioedema]], and [[USMLE/Infective disease/Lyme disease\|Lyme disease]]. | [[USMLE/Infective disease/Lyme disease\|Lyme disease]]                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Often triggered by infections (especially [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]), but can also be caused by medications, vaccinations and other infections.                                                                                                           | Can be idiopathic (up to 55% of cases).  Associated with infections (streptococcal infections, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|TB]], etc.), [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sarcoidosis\|sarcoidosis]], IBD, [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|pregnancy]], medications (sulfa drugs, oral [[USMLE/Reproductive/Contraception\|contraceptives]]).      |
| **Appearance**     | Classic "slapped-cheek" appearance (bright red rash on face), followed by a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lacy, reticular rash on the trunk and extremities.</span> | Evanescent (fades in and out), non-pruritic, blanchable, pink to red macules or papules that spread peripherally, forming rings or polycyclic shapes with central clearing.                                | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Expanding</span>, round or oval erythematous patch at the site of a tick bite.  May have a "bull's-eye" appearance (central clearing), but this is not always present. | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">"Target" lesions </span>(classic): concentric rings of color variation.  May also have atypical raised papules. Distribution is symmetrical, often on extremities (especially hands and feet).         | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tender</span>, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules or plaques, typically on the shins (anterior lower legs), but can also appear on knees and arms. Lesions evolve, becoming bruise-like. |
| **Location**       | Starts on the face (cheeks), then spreads to trunk and extremities.                                                                                                                   | Primarily on trunk and proximal extremities; spares the face.                                                                                                                                              | Starts at the site of the tick bite (can be anywhere on the body).                                                                                                                                                     | Often favors extremities (especially hands, feet, elbows, knees), but can be widespread.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mucosal involvement (mouth, genitals, eyes) is possible</span>, especially in [[USMLE/MSK/Erythema multiforme\|Erythema Multiforme]] Major. | Primarily on the shins (anterior lower legs), but can involve other areas.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Other Symptoms** | Mild fever, malaise, myalgias, headache, sometimes diarrhea and vomiting.  In adults, may cause joint pain (arthralgia/arthritis).                                                    | Associated with other symptoms of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute rheumatic fever\|rheumatic fever]] (fever, joint pain, carditis).  Lesions themselves are typically asymptomatic (non-itchy, non-painful).                       | May be accompanied by flu-like symptoms (fatigue, headache, fever, muscle/joint pain).                                                                                                                                 | May have prodromal symptoms (fatigue, fever, itching) before skin lesions. Lesions can be painful, itchy or swollen.                                                                                                                                   | Often preceded or accompanied by fever, malaise, and joint pain (arthralgia, especially ankles).                                                                                                                                         |
| **Duration**       | Rash typically lasts 1-3 weeks.                                                                                                                                                       | Evanescent; may appear and disappear within hours, or last for days to weeks, often recurring.                                                                                                             | Expands over days to weeks.  Can persist for weeks to months if untreated.                                                                                                                                             | Usually self-limiting, resolving within 2-4 weeks (minor) or longer (major). Can be recurrent, especially if associated with [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]].                                                                                                   | Typically resolves within 3-6 weeks, but can last longer depending on the underlying cause.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Diagnosis**      | Usually a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic rash.  [[USMLE/Infective disease/Parvovirus B19\|Parvovirus B19]] serology (IgG, IgM) or PCR can confirm.                                                            | Clinical diagnosis, often in the context of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute rheumatic fever\|rheumatic fever]].                                                                                                                    | Clinical diagnosis based on history of tick bite and characteristic rash.  Serological tests for [[USMLE/Infective disease/Lyme disease\|Lyme disease]] are often unreliable in early stages.                                                                | Clinical diagnosis based on appearance and distribution of lesions.  Biopsy can be helpful, but is not always necessary.  Identify and treat underlying cause (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]).                                                          | Clinical diagnosis.  Investigations to identify underlying cause may include throat swab (for strep), chest X-ray (for [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sarcoidosis\|sarcoidosis]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|TB]]), and blood tests.  Skin biopsy can confirm.                                |
| **Treatment**      | Symptomatic treatment (rest, fluids, pain relievers).                                                                                                                                 | Treat underlying condition ([[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute rheumatic fever\|rheumatic fever]]). The rash itself does not require specific treatment.                                                                              | [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|Antibiotics]] (doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime).                                                                                                                                                             | Mild cases may not require treatment.  Antiviral medication (acyclovir) for [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-related EM.  Topical [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|corticosteroids]] for symptomatic relief.  Severe cases may require systemic [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|steroids]].                  | Treatment of underlying cause.  Rest, leg elevation, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]] for pain and inflammation.  Potassium iodide or systemic [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|corticosteroids]] may be used in some cases.                                           |
