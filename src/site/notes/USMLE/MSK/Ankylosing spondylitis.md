# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Genetic predisposition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">90–95% of patients are [[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-B27]] positive.</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- AS is distinct from rheumatoid arthritis:
    - AS → simultaneous bone erosion AND new bone formation.
    - Rheumatoid arthritis → primarily only erosions.
- **Initial Pathogenesis (Inflammatory Phase):**
    - Driven partly by inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-17) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activation of osteoclast precursor cells → bony erosions.</span>
    - Bony erosions occur primarily in vertebral bodies → destruction of the trabecular microarchitecture → increased risk for secondary osteoporosis and compression fractures.
- **Reparative Process (Post-Inflammation):**
    - Inflammation subsides → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reparative process begins → excessive new bone formation</span>.
    - New bone formation occurs especially where fat metaplasia fills previously eroded sites.
    - In contrast to erosion, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bone formation occurs primarily at the periosteum-cartilage junction → manifests as bridging syndesmophytes in the vertebral column.</span>
    - Bridging syndesmophytes → spinal rigidity → postural alterations → increased risk of fracture.
- Initiation of innate immune response
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Release of cytokines (TGF-beta and TNF-α) and interleukins (IL-17 and IL-23)</span>
- Infiltration of paravertebral and sacroiliac entheses with macrophages, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enthesitis</span>: an inflammation of the enthesis (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the point at which a tendon attaches to bone</span>). Typically seen in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-associated juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or [[USMLE/MSK/Reactive arthritis\|reactive arthritis]]. Commonly affected sites include the spine, Achilles tendon, plantar fascia, and supraspinatus tendon.![Pasted image 20240528110203.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240528110203.png)
- Chronic enthesitis leads to: 
	1. Erosion of the iliac part of the sacroiliac joints 
	2. Vertical formation of syndesmophytes along the spinal ligament or around the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral discs
	3. Fusion of syndesmophytes → ankylosis of intervertebral discs and vertebral bodies ![Pasted image 20240403202841.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240403202841.png)

# Clinical features
---
- Inflammatory [[USMLE/MSK/Back pain\|back pain]] (sacroiliitis)
	- Insidious onset at age <40
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Morning stiffness > 30 minutes that improves with activity</span>
	- Pain is independent of positioning
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relieved with exercise, worse with rest (overnight & in the morning)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relieved with activity & warm showers</span>
	- Nocturnal pain
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced chest expansion & spinal mobility</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stiff or stooped posture</span>![Pasted image 20240403203218.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240403203218.png)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tenderness at spine, sacroiliac joints & peripheral tendon insertions (eg, Achilles)</span>
- Enthesitis (tenderness at tendon insertion sites)
- Dactylitis (swelling of fingers & toes)
- Uveitis

# Diagnostics
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">AS is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, and there are no serologic tests to confirm the diagnosis.</span>
## Laboratory findings
- Elevated ESR & CRP
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-B27]]</span>: Positive in 90–95% of patients with axial spondyloarthritis
- Autoantibodies (e.g., rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies) are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">negative</span>
## X-ray
- Sacroiliitis: bone erosions, subchondral sclerosis, eventual bony fusion (ankylosis)
- Bridging syndesmophytes: ossification at vertebral body margins <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(bamboo spine)</span>
