The radial head is anchored to the ulna by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">annular ligament</span>, which encircles the proximal radius.  In children age <5, this tissue is relatively thin compared to older children and adults.  Sudden axial traction (eg, pulling up on the arm by the hand) or twisting can cause the annular ligament to slip over the radial head and become entrapped in the radiohumeral joint.![Pasted image 20250420111427.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250420111427.png)
