# Epidemiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common malignancy in patients with untreated [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]]</span>

---
# Etiology
- Caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">human herpesvirus 8 ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HHV]]-8)</span>, a large DNA gamma herpes virus
- Routes of transmission include
	- Saliva
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sexual contact</span>
	- Potentially via blood [[USMLE/Blood/Transfusion\|transfusion]] and IV drug use

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HHV]]-8 infects vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells</span>, causing them to differentiate into a mixed phenotype thought to increase oncogenic potential.  The [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HHV]]-8 genome contains several viral [[USMLE/Pathology/Oncogenes\|oncogenes]] that inhibit cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, thereby <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">promoting endothelial cell growth and tumorigenesis</span>

# Clinical features
Patients typically present with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">multiple cutaneous or visceral elevated tumors with rapid growth.</span>
- Most commonly affects the skin but may also involve the lymph nodes, mucosa, and viscera
- Can occur at any CD4 count (typically < 500/mm3)
- Initial stage: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless, nonpruritic, violet papules or nodules on skin and mucosa (especially face/oral cavity and chest) </span>![Pasted image 20231028161117.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231028161117.png)
	- Solitary, darkly pigmented plaques, which can evolve into nodular, bluish, submucosal, and painful skin changes
	- Lesions resemble those of bacillary angiomatosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progression: may disseminate to the organs, particularly the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and lymph nodes.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrointestinal tract involvement</span>: abdominal pain and [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]]; hemorrhage and bowel obstruction in severe cases 
		- Often polypoid nodules![Pasted image 20241016092915.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241016092915.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary involvement</span>: Lesions cause [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|dyspnea]], cough, and/or hemoptysis.

# Diagnostics
- Biopsy and histology of cutaneous or visceral lesions (indicated in all patients)
	- Dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">slit-like vascular spaces, red blood cell extravasation</span>, and inflammation.![L85243.png](/img/user/appendix/L85243.png)
