# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Primary lymphedema (rare): idiopathic, resulting from congenital abnormalities in lymphatic vessels, e.g., in Turner syndrome
- Secondary lymphedema: physical disruption of lymphatic drainage
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lymphadenectomy, radiation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malignant obstruction</span>
	- Chronic inflammation (eg, recurrent cellulitis)
	- Parasitic infection (eg, filariasis)

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless unilateral or bilateral swelling of limbs</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In early disease, the edema is pitting and the skin remains soft.</span>  However, over time there is progressive deposition of subcutaneous collagen and adipose tissue, which leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">firm, dry, and thickened skin and nonpitting edema</span>
	- Swelling of toes and dorsal feet with deep flexion creases
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lymphedema involves the toes</span>, unlike venous edema, which typically spares the toes.

# Treatment
---
- Manual lymphatic drainage: a form of massage that is applied in the direction of the heart to increase the natural drainage of lymph
- Compression garments, e.g., multilayer compression stockings (applied by a specialist)
	- Should be applied by a trained professional (e.g., a physiotherapist or clinical lymphologist) as they can be harmful or ineffective when applied incorrectly.
