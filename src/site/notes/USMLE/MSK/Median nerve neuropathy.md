# Common causes
---
- Proximal injury: supracondylar fracture of humerus
- Distal injury
	- Carpal tunnel compression
	- Wrist laceration (suicide attempt)

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The key is whether flexor digitorum profundus is damaged.</span>
- Nerves controlling flexor digitorum profundus branches out below the elbow. So it's spared in distal lesion, but included in proximal lesion. So the claw hand is more prominent in distal lesion.
- Anterior Interosseous Nerve -> flexor digitorum profundus -> flexion of index and middle finger![Pasted image 20240221084813.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240221084813.png)
	- Flexor digitorum profundus
		- has dual innervation: the medial part is supplied by [[USMLE/MSK/Ulnar nerve entrapment\|ulnar nerve]]
		- Controls wrist, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MCP, and DIP joints</span>: flexion
- Flexor digitorum superficialis
	- Controls wrist, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MCP, and PIP joints</span>: flexion
- Lumbricals and interossei![Pasted image 20240221090820.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240221090820.png)
- Ape hand: inability to oppose and abduct the thumb due to injury of the proximal or distal median nerves impairing the thenar muscles' functions
# Carpal tunnel syndrome
- Results from a lesion that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduces</span> the size of the carpal tunnel (fluid retention, infection, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dislocation of lunate bone</span>)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Median nerve</span> â€“ most sensitive structure in the carpal tunnel and is the most affected
- Risk factors
	- Manual work: increased risk in workers using vibrating tools or prolonged, forceful, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repetitive flexion/extension of the wrist</span>
	- [[USMLE/MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis\|Rheumatoid arthritis]], [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoarthritis\|Osteoarthritis]]
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]]
	- Systemic [[USMLE/Pathology/Amyloidosis\|amyloidosis]] 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Renal failure and dialysis-associated deposition of amyloid</span>
		- Deposition of beta-2 microglobulin (dialysis-associated [[USMLE/Pathology/Amyloidosis\|amyloidosis]]) in the carpal tunnel (injection site)
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]]
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|Hypothyroidism]]
- Clinical manifestations:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pins and needles or anesthesia of the lateral 3.5 digits </span>![Pasted image 20240403141327.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240403141327.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palm sensation is not affected</span> because superficial palmar cutaneous branch passes superficially to carpal tunnel
		- Similar situation in [[USMLE/MSK/Ulnar nerve entrapment\|Guyon canal syndrome]]
	- Ape hand deformity - absent of OPPOSITION
