# Bone remodeling in cortical bone
![Pasted image 20240402162925.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240402162925.png)
## Degradation
- Osteoclasts organize in a basic multicellular unit (BMU) and excavate a tunnel in the cortical bone. 
- Connective tissue vessels and unmyelinated nerves grow in the tunnel.
## Formation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Osteoclasts are followed by osteoblasts → deposition of the first osteoid layer in the tunnel</span>
- Additional osteoblasts follow and deposit osteoid onto the first osteoid layer → osteoblasts of the first layer are walled in → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">osteoblasts become osteocytes</span>
	- Osteocyte function relies on the presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gap junctions</span> that connect the cytoplasmic processes between osteocytes.  These junctions facilitate cell-to-cell communication, allowing intracellular signals (eg, calcium, cyclic AMP) to propagate to neighboring cells.
- The deposition process is repeated until the tunnel is almost full → central Haversian canal remains open
- The innermost (i.e., last) generation of osteoblasts is no longer walled in → cells return to their resting state and form the endosteum
## Mineralization: occurs successively
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Osteoblasts secrete [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]] and vesicles into the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|extracellular matrix]].</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vesicles contain enzymes (e.g., [[USMLE/Blood/Alkaline phosphatase\|alkaline phosphatase]]), which increase local phosphate levels (e.g., by cleavage of pyrophosphate).</span>
- Calcium-binding molecules in the vesicles most likely serve as a focal point.
- Initial formation of hydroxyapatite crystals around the focal point in the vesicles
- Independent growth of the crystals until penetration of the vesicle membrane
- Release of crystals in the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|extracellular matrix]]
- Growth of crystals in the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|extracellular matrix]] and accumulation of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]] fibrils
# Regulation of bone remodeling
- RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB): receptor on osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors, for interaction with osteoblasts
- RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Membrane-bound protein of osteoblasts that stimulates osteoclasts by interacting with RANK</span>
	- Ensures fusion and differentiation into activated osteoclasts and prevents their apoptosis
- Osteoprotegerin (OPG)
	- A regulatory protein secreted by osteoblasts that binds RANKL
	- Inhibits RANK-RANKL interaction, leading to decreased osteoclast activity
- Mechanical load (Wolff's law)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Load on the bone leads to increased bone mass.</span>
	- Absence of load (e.g., due to being confined in bed) results in decreased bone mass.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sensed by osteocytes</span> via extracellular attachments (eg, integrins) to the canalicular walls, resulting in the release of mediators—such as soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B (RANKL) and sclerostin—that orchestrate bone remodeling
- Hormones
	- PTH effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At low levels: increased bone formation and increased apoptosis of osteoclasts → decreased bone resorption ([[USMLE/Endocrine/Anabolic and Catabolic effects\|anabolic effects]])</span>
		- At high levels (e.g., primary [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperparathyroidism\|hyperparathyroidism]]): activation of osteoclasts → increased bone resorption ([[USMLE/Endocrine/Anabolic and Catabolic effects\|catabolic effects]]) → [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]] or osteitis fibrosa cystica
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Estrogen]] effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibits apoptosis of osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulates apoptosis of osteoclasts, leading to decreased bone resorption</span>
		- Stimulates closure of the epiphyseal plate in puberty
		- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Estrogen]] deficiency (e.g., postmenopausal or after bilateral oophorectomy) leads to increased bone resorption, which can result in [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]].
	- Thyroid hormone
		- In <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-standing [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]]</span>, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T3 stimulates osteoclast differentiation, increased bone resorption, and release of calcium.</span>
