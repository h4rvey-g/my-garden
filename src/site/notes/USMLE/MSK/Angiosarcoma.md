- Definition: a rare, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">very aggressive vascular malignancy, arising from endothelial cells of blood or lymphatic vessels</span> 
- Epidemiology: peak incidence age > 70 years 
- Etiology 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Radiation (e.g., [[USMLE/Pathology/Radiation therapy\|radiation therapy]])</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic [[USMLE/Endocrine/Nonpitting edema\|lymphedema]]: especially in postmastectomy lymph node resection</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Likely due to a combination of increased lymphatic proliferation, which increases the likelihood of malignant cells, and a decreased number of lymph nodes, which decreases the ability to remove the malignant cells.</span>
	- Chemicals: Vinyl chloride and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Arsenic toxicity\|arsenic]] are implicated in hepatic angiosarcoma.
- Clinical features 
	- Location
		- More common in sun-exposed areas
		- Usually occur on the head, neck, and breast
		- May involve the internal organs (e.g., hepatic angiosarcoma)
	- Lesion
