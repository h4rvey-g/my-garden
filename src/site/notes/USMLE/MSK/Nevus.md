# Melanocytic nevus
---
- Melanocytic nevus (mole) is a benign cutaneous tumor composed of pigment-producing nevus cells derived from melanocytes.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Histopathology: well-nested melanocytic proliferations at the dermal-epidermal junction</span>
## Common acquired melanocytic nevus
- Definition: an acquired melanocytic nevus that arises from clusters of melanocytic nevus cells in the epidermis and dermis and manifests as a uniformly pigmented lesion 
- Epidemiology: common regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity
- Clinical features 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly on sun-exposed areas </span>
	- Uniform in color and shape
- Stages![highresdefault_L26037.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L26037.jpg)
	- Junctional nevus 
		- Uniformly brown-black macule with a flat smooth, hairless surface and well-demarcated border![Pasted image 20250210200113.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250210200113.png)
		- Grows at the dermal-epidermal junction during childhood
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compound nevus</span> 
		- Uniformly brown-black, dome-shaped elevated papule or nodule with a smooth or verrucous surface; hair may be present![Pasted image 20250210200204.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250210200204.png)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arises from a junctional nevus and extends to the dermis</span> after childhood
	- Dermal nevus
		- Uniformly brown-black, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dome-shaped elevated nodule</span> with a smooth or verrucous surface; can become fibrotic over time and hair may be present![Pasted image 20250210200138.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250210200138.png)
