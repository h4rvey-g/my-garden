# Epidemiology
- Most common type of skeletal dysplasia
- Most common cause of disproportionate short stature

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gain of function mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3)</span> on chromosome 4

---
# Pathophysiology
- Defective FGFR3 → continuous receptor stimulation by FGF → inhibited chondrocyte proliferation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ endochondral ossification → impaired longitudinal bone growth</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal intramembranous ossification of the craniofacial bones → disproportionately large head in relation to the limbs</span>

>[!tip] 
>GH deficiency can lead to proportional short stature (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">both long and flat bones affected</span>) as opposed to the disproportionate short stature seen in achondroplasia (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">only long bones affected</span>).

# Clinical features
- Stature 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disproportionate short stature </span>
	- Normal-sized torso
	- Short, plump extremities
- Craniofacial abnormalities
	- Middle ear deformation: recurrent [[USMLE/MSK/Acute otitis media\|otitis media]]
- Other skeletal abnormalities
	- Small foramen magnum: compression of the cervical medulla
	- Lumbar lordosis and kyphoscoliosis 
	- Spinal canal stenosis: lower back and leg pain, paresthesias, dysesthesia, incontinence
