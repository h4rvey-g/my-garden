# AL amyloidosis (primary amyloidosis)
Most common form of amyloidosis
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Clonal plasma cell disorder (e.g., [[USMLE/Blood/Multiple myeloma\|multiple myeloma]], MGUS) produces abnormal immunoglobulin light chains (L in AL) that misfold and deposit in tissues. This is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis.</span>
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Highly variable. Often presents with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Renal/Nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]] ([[USMLE/Renal/Proteinuria\|proteinuria]]), [[USMLE/Cardiology/Restrictive cardiomyopathy\|restrictive cardiomyopathy]] (HFpEF, arrhythmia), peripheral/autonomic neuropathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and macroglossia.</span> "Raccoon eyes" (periorbital purpura) is a classic but less common sign.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Screening:** Serum/urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP/UPEP) with immunofixation and serum free light chain (FLC) assay to detect a monoclonal protein.
    *   **Gold Standard:** Tissue biopsy (abdominal fat pad, bone marrow, or affected organ) showing **apple-green birefringence** on **Congo red staining** under polarized light.
    *   **Typing:** Mass spectrometry or immunohistochemistry on the biopsy is crucial to confirm the amyloid is from light chains.
*   **Management/Treatment:** Aims to eliminate the underlying plasma cell clone.
    *   **First-line:** Chemotherapy, often a combination like Dara-CyBorD (daratumumab, cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, dexamethasone).
    *   Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) may be an option for eligible patients.

# AA amyloidosis (secondary amyloidosis)
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** Occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secondary to chronic inflammatory or infectious conditions</span> (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis\|rheumatoid arthritis]], IBD, chronic infections like [[USMLE/MSK/Osteomyelitis\|osteomyelitis]] or [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]], FMF). <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic inflammation leads to persistently high levels of serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute-phase reactant, which is then cleaved and deposited as amyloid A (AA) protein.</span>
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Primarily affects the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">kidneys</span>, causing [[USMLE/Renal/Proteinuria\|proteinuria]] and [[USMLE/Renal/Nephrotic syndrome\|nephrotic syndrome]], which can progress to ESRD. Hepatosplenomegaly is also common.
*   **Diagnosis:** Same biopsy findings as AL (Congo red positive). Diagnosis requires excluding AL and identifying an underlying chronic inflammatory state.
*   **Management/Treatment:** Treat the underlying inflammatory or infectious disease to reduce SAA production. For example, colchicine for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

>[!tip] 
>Amyloidosis should always be considered in patients who present with kidney, liver, or GI involvement in the setting of chronic inflammatory and/or infectious disease.

# ATTR (Transthyretin) Amyloidosis
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deposition of transthyretin (TTR), a protein mainly produced by the liver.</span>
    *   **Hereditary (ATTRv):** Caused by a mutation in the TTR gene, leading to an unstable protein.
    *   **Wild-Type (ATTRwt):** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs in older individuals (>65) due to age-related instability of normal TTR protein (formerly called senile systemic amyloidosis).</span>
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Cardiac:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Restrictive cardiomyopathy\|Restrictive cardiomyopathy]]</span> is the hallmark, especially in ATTRwt.![L44816.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L44816.jpg)
    *   **Neurologic:** Peripheral and autonomic neuropathy are common, especially in ATTRv.
    *   **Other:** Bilateral [[USMLE/MSK/Median nerve neuropathy\|carpal tunnel syndrome]] often precedes cardiac symptoms by years.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   In a patient with suspected cardiac amyloidosis, if monoclonal protein tests are negative, a **technetium-99m-pyrophosphate (PYP) scan** is highly specific for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis (shows strong myocardial uptake).
    *   Genetic testing is required to differentiate between ATTRv and ATTRwt.
*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   **TTR Stabilizers:** (e.g., Tafamidis, Diflunisal) prevent TTR from misfolding.
    *   **TTR Silencers:** (e.g., Patisiran, Inotersen) are RNA-interference agents that reduce the production of TTR by the liver.
    *   Supportive care for [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]] is crucial.

# Dialysis-Related Amyloidosis (Aβ₂M)

- **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deposition of **β₂-microglobulin (β₂M)**, a normal component of the MHC Class I molecule.</span>
    - In ESRD, β₂M is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not adequately filtered by</span> the kidneys or by older, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**low-flux hemodialysis membranes**.</span>
    - Chronically elevated serum levels of β₂M lead to its <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deposition as amyloid fibrils, primarily in osteoarticular structures.</span>
- **Clinical Presentation:**
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Almost exclusively seen in patients on **long-term dialysis** (typically >5-10 years).</span>
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Presentation is primarily **musculoskeletal**.</span>
    - Key Manifestations:
        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Carpal tunnel syndrome** (often the first sign).</span>
        - **Scapulohumeral periarthritis** (destructive arthritis of the shoulder, causing chronic shoulder pain and limited motion).
        - Destructive **spondyloarthropathy** (affecting the spine).
        - Bone cysts and pathologic fractures.
- **Diagnosis:**
    
    - Primarily a clinical diagnosis based on characteristic symptoms in a long-term dialysis patient.
    - Biopsy of affected tissue (e.g., synovial membrane) shows classic **Congo red staining** with apple-green birefringence.
    - Immunohistochemistry or mass spectrometry is required to confirm the protein is β₂M.
- **Management/Treatment:**
    
    - **Prevention:** Use of modern, **high-flux dialysis membranes** or hemodiafiltration, which are more effective at clearing β₂M.
    - **Definitive Treatment:** Successful **kidney transplantation** is curative, as it restores normal renal clearance of β₂M.
    - Symptomatic management for arthropathy (e.g., NSAIDs with caution, physical therapy, joint surgery).
