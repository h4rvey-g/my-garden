**General Principle:** Tumor markers are most useful for **monitoring disease progression, response to treatment, and detecting recurrence**. They are generally **NOT** used for screening or initial diagnosis due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">low sensitivity and specificity</span>.

# Key Tumor Markers

*   **[[USMLE/Reproductive/Alpha fetoprotein\|AFP]] (Alpha-fetoprotein)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **H**epatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
        *   **Y**olk sac (endodermal sinus) tumor and other non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Used to screen high-risk groups (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]], hepatitis) for HCC. Also used for prognosis and monitoring treatment response in HCC and germ cell tumors.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]], hepatitis, [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]].
    *   **Mnemonic:** "**A**wful **F**at **P**roducer" ([[USMLE/Reproductive/Alpha fetoprotein\|AFP]] for HCC/Yolk Sac).

*   **[[USMLE/Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin\|Î²-hCG]] ([[USMLE/Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin\|Human chorionic gonadotropin]])**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **H**ydatidiform moles and **C**horiocarcinoma (Gestational Trophoblastic Disease).
        *   **G**erm cell tumors (e.g., [[USMLE/Reproductive/Testicular tumors\|testicular cancer]], especially non-seminomatous types).
    *   **Clinical Use:** Diagnosis and monitoring of gestational trophoblastic disease and certain germ cell tumors.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|Pregnancy]] (produced by syncytiotrophoblasts).

*   **CA 19-9 (Carbohydrate antigen 19-9)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Pancreatic adenocarcinoma** (most specific).
        *   Cholangiocarcinoma, [[USMLE/GI/Gastric cancer\|gastric cancer]], [[USMLE/GI/Colorectal cancer\|colorectal cancer]].
    *   **Clinical Use:** Primarily for monitoring treatment response in pancreatic cancer. Very high levels may suggest unresectable disease.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** Biliary obstruction (cholangitis), pancreatitis, liver disease.
    *   **Note:** Not produced in Lewis antigen-negative individuals (~5-10% of population).

*   **CA 125 (Cancer antigen 125)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Ovarian cancer** (epithelial type).
    *   **Clinical Use:** Monitoring response to therapy and detecting recurrence in ovarian cancer.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** Endometriosis, pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis.

*   **CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Colorectal cancer** (most common use).
        *   Pancreatic, gastric, breast, lung cancers.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Monitoring for recurrence of colorectal cancer after resection. A return to normal levels after surgery suggests complete resection.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** **Smoking** (very common), IBD, pancreatitis, liver disease.

*   **PSA (Prostate-specific antigen)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Prostate cancer**.
    *   **Clinical Use:** Used for screening (controversial), staging, and monitoring for recurrence after treatment.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, recent ejaculation, prostatic massage/biopsy.
    *   **Differentiating Factors:** **Free/total PSA ratio** can help distinguish BPH from cancer; a lower ratio suggests malignancy. PSA velocity (rate of rise) is also useful.

*   **Calcitonin**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)** (produced by parafollicular C-cells).
    *   **Clinical Use:** Diagnosis, staging, and monitoring for recurrence of MTC. Very high levels (>100 pg/mL) are highly suggestive of MTC.
    *   **Key Association:** All patients with MTC should be screened for **MEN 2A and 2B** syndromes (RET proto-oncogene mutation).
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** Chronic kidney disease, neuroendocrine tumors (e.g., carcinoid), some lung cancers.

*   **LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase)**
    *   **Associated Cancers:**
        *   **Highly non-specific**. Elevated in many cancers, especially those with high cell turnover, bulk, or necrosis (e.g., testicular cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, Ewing sarcoma).
    *   **Clinical Use:** Primarily a prognostic marker indicating tumor burden and cell turnover.
    *   **Non-neoplastic elevations:** Hemolysis (artifactual elevation), MI, liver disease, muscle injury.
