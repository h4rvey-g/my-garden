# Mechanism
---
Radiation therapy primarily kills cancer cells by **damaging their DNA**. This happens in two main ways:

1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Direct Action:** The radiation directly hits and ionizes the DNA molecule.</span>
2. **Indirect Action (More Common for X-rays/Gamma rays):** Radiation interacts with water in the cell, creating highly reactive **free radicals** (especially hydroxyl radicals, OH⋅). These free radicals then diffuse and damage the DNA.

**Key Points for USMLE:**

- **Main Target:** DNA
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Lethal Lesion:** **Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs)** are the most difficult for cells to repair and are the primary cause of cell death.</span>
- **Cell Death:** The most common way irradiated cancer cells die is through **mitotic catastrophe** – they attempt to divide with damaged DNA and fail, leading to cell death. Apoptosis also occurs.
- **Oxygen Effect:** Radiation is more effective in the presence of oxygen because oxygen helps "fix" the free radical-induced damage, making it permanent. Hypoxic (low oxygen) tumors are more radioresistant.

High doses of ionizing radiation (e.g., radiotherapy, nuclear accidents) cause DNA and cellular damage. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Certain rapidly regenerating tissues (e.g., skin, gastrointestinal tissue, bone marrow) are more susceptible due to the depletion of immature parenchymal stem cells.</span> Cancerous cells are more susceptible to radiation than healthy cells due to their high replication rates and dysfunctional [[USMLE/Biochemistry/DNA repair\|DNA repair]] mechanisms.
- Mechanism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DNA double-strand breakage</span>: Breakage of both strands is required; single-strand breaks can be repaired by polymerases.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generation of reactive oxygen species: Unstable molecules formed by the ionization of water; oxygen free radicals can cause cellular and DNA damage.</span>
- Easily affected cells:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GI: Intestinal crypt stem cells</span>
	- Bone marrow: hematopoietic progenitors ([[USMLE/Blood/Pancytopenia\|pancytopenia]])
	- Gonads: spermatogonia (infertility)
	- Skin: basal keratinocytes, hair follicle stem cells (desquamation, hair loss)
## Acute radiation syndrome
### <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Skin and mucosa (these are rapidly regenerating tissues)</span>
- [[USMLE/MSK/Erythema differential diagnostics\|Erythema]], desquamation, blisters, ulcers, necrosis
- Stomatitis, dysphagia
- [[USMLE/Neurology/Cataract\|Cataracts]]
- Hair loss
- Radiation dermatitis
	- Acute (<90 days after radiotherapy):
		- Apoptosis of basal keratinocytes and epidermal edema
		- Dose-dependent effects ranging from erythema to desquamation (ie, skin peeling), superficial ulceration, and/or blistering
		- Pigment changes and loss of skin appendages (eg, hair follicles, sebaceous glands)
	- Late (months to years after radiotherapy):
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrosis, characterized histologically by homogenization of dermal collagen, due to fibroblast activation by transforming growth factor-beta from damaged tissue and responding immune cells</span>
		- Vascular damage, resulting in chronic hypoxia and ulceration
		- Abnormal, dilated microvasculature (ie, telangiectasias)
### Respiratory![L60758.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L60758.jpg)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early radiation-induced lung injury: radiation pneumonitis</span>
	- Usually develops within<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> 3–12 weeks of radiation</span>
	- Caused by an acute release of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6) 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Common symptoms: [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|dyspnea]], dry cough, hemoptysis, and fever (patients may be asymptomatic)</span>
	- Partial respiratory insufficiency is an early sign.
## Chronic radiation injury
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Results in fibrosis and/or cancer</span>
### Respiratory
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Late radiation-induced lung injury: radiation fibrosis</span>
	- Usually develops after <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">6–12 months of radiation</span>
### Genitourinary
- Impaired fertility
	- Ovarian, vulvar and/or vaginal fibrosis, [[USMLE/Reproductive/Amenorrhea\|amenorrhea]]
	- Azoospermia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urethral and ureteral stenosis, lead to [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary incontinence\|Urinary incontinence]]</span>
