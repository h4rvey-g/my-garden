# Bones, muscles, and joints
---
- Increased bone resorption and osteoporosis, increased risk of fracture (♀ > ♂)
	- Postmenopausal osteoporosis: decreased estrogen levels → increased bone resorption 
	- Senile osteoporosis (especially in individuals > 70 years): decreased osteoblast activity → decreased osteoid production
- Decreased lean body mass due to atrophy and loss of muscle cells (sarcopenia) 
- Degenerative changes in joints: stiffer and less flexible joints, decreased synovial fluid and cartilage, calcification (e.g., in the shoulder), height loss
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone marrow: decreased mass, increased percentage of fat, weaker response to stimuli (e.g., ↓ hematopoiesis following blood loss)</span>
# Respiratory system

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lung compliance increases ("loose, baggy lungs") due to loss of elastin content.  This process resembles mild emphysema and leads to dynamic expiratory airflow obstruction, premature airway closure, and progressive hyperinflation.</span>
- Chest wall compliance decreases ("stiff rib cage") due to degenerative changes (ossification, arthritis) of the sternocostal and costovertebral joints and kyphosis of the thoracic spine.
- Total respiratory system compliance, the combination of lung parenchymal and chest wall compliance, is decreased because the stiffness of the chest wall dominates over the increased laxity of the lung.
# Cardiovascular system
---
- Aortic stiffening
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elastin replacement with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]]</span>
	- ↑ Pulse pressure (isolated systolic HTN)
- Mild concentric LVH
	- Response to cardiomyocyte dropout & ↑ afterload
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ left ventricular cavity size and sigmoid-shaped interventricular septum</span>
	- Resting EF, SV & cardiac output maintained
	- ↓ Maximal cardiac output
- Conduction cell degeneration
	- Slightly ↓ resting heart rate
	- ↓ Maximal heart rate
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduced baroreceptor sensitivity & adrenergic responsiveness</span>
	- ↑ Orthostasis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Heart rate & contractility response</span>
- Formation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lipofuscin deposits</span> within cells. See [[USMLE/Pathology/Cellular adaptations\|Cellular adaptations]]
# Skin
---
- Senile purpura: recurrent, irregularly shaped, dark purple macules 
	- Progressive loss of connective tissue, subcutaneous fat, and blood vessel elasticity → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extravasation of blood into the dermis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Heatstroke due to decreased number of sweat glands</span>
	- Also due to 
		- Loss of rete pegs and dermal capillaries, which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduces the effective epidermal area available for heat transfer</span>
		- Tonic contraction of the peripheral vasculature, which limits heat transfer to the skin
# Nervous system
---
- Presbyopia
	- Pathophysiology: age-related <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decrease in lens elasticity, strength of ciliary muscle, and lens curvature</span> → decreased lens accommodation (focusing on an object up close)

# Upper aerodigestive tract
---
- Salivary glands
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acinar atrophy, fatty infiltration</span>
	- Reduced saliva production
	- Xerostomia, dental caries
- Oral/oropharyngeal muscles
	- Decreased muscle mass & tissue elasticity
	- Weakness & dyscoordination of masticatory, tongue & pharyngeal muscles
	- Increased transit time, decreased coordination
- Other effects
	- Mucosal atrophy
	- Decreased taste & smell
	- Impaired airway protective reflexes
# Beers criteria

Common medications to avoid in older adults
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anticholinergic (cause urinary retention and constipation)</span>
	- First-generation [[USMLE/Immunology/Antihistamines\|antihistamines]]
		- Also has strong sedative effect
	- Gastrointestinal antispasmodics
- Cardiovascular (may elevate the risk of orthostatic hypotension)
	- Alpha-1 blockers (as antihypertensives)
	- Centrally acting alpha-2 agonists
	- Many [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antiarrhythmic drugs\|antiarrhythmics]]
- CNS (can cause sedation, cognitive impairment, and/or [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Delirium\|delirium]] → ↑ risk of falls and fractures)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tricyclic [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antidepressants\|antidepressants]]</span>
	- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|Antipsychotics]]
	- Barbiturates, [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|benzodiazepines]] & other hypnotics
- Endocrine (increased risk of [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]])
	- Long-acting sulfonylureas
	- Sliding-scale insulin
		- Doses are not consistent
- Pain (risk of GI bleeding and [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|AKI]])
	- Nonselective [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]]
	- Skeletal muscle relaxants
