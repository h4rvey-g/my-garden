## Fibrinoid necrosis
- Definition: a type of necrosis characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small blood vessel injury with accumulation of fibrin and other plasma proteins.</span>
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vessel wall damage caused by immune complex deposition (e.g., due to [[USMLE/Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions\|type III hypersensitivity reaction]]) → fragmentation of collagenous and elastic fibers  → leakage of fibrin and other plasma proteins</span>
- Microscopic appearance
	- Visible damage: thick walls with fragments of embedded cellular debris, serum, and fibrin
	- Affected necrotic areas stain intense red.
- Examples
