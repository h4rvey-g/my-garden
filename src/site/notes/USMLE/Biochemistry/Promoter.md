- Specific DNA sequence located upstream (= in the 5ï¿½?region) of a gene that regulates transcription
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains AT-rich sequences (e.g., TATA box and CAAT box)</span>
- Binding site for [[USMLE/Biochemistry/RNA polymerases\|RNA polymerase]] II and several other transcription factors at the start of transcription 
- Mutations at the site of promoters usually lead to severely decreased transcription rate.
- Promotors increase the replication activity at the origin of replication (ori)
