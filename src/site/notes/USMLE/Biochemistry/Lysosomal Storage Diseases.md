>	- **Retinal Ganglion Cell Accumulation:** In these diseases, the defective lysosomal enzymes lead to an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accumulation of undigested substrates (like lipids) within the cells, including the ganglion cells of the retina.</span>
>	- **Macular Opacity:** The ganglion cell layer is particularly thick in the [[USMLE/Neurology/Eye and orbit\|macula]], the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The buildup of these materials in the ganglion cells around the fovea makes this area appear pale or opaque.</span>
>	- **Foveal Contrast:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The fovea centralis, the very center of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Eye and orbit\|macula]], is extremely thin and lacks ganglion cells.</span> It derives its blood supply from the choroid, not the retinal circulation. Therefore, it's not affected by the storage material accumulation in the same way.
>	- **Cherry-Red Appearance:** Because the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">surrounding area becomes pale due to the accumulated substances, the unaffected fovea maintains its normal reddish appearance (due to the underlying choroidal blood supply)</span>, creating a contrasting "cherry-red spot" in the center.

>3. Hunter doesn't have corneal cloudy -> or he couldn't see targets
>4. Hunters are aggressive

# I-cell disease

- Definition: an autosomal recessive disease caused by a defect in N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase activity
- Pathophysiology
	- Defective N-acetylglucosaminyl-1-phosphotransferase �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired phosphorylation of mannose residues of glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus that should be transported to lysosomes (glycoproteins do not have mannose-6-phosphate) �?extracellular secretion of these glycoproteins</span> instead of delivery to lysosomes �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inability to degrade lysosomal content</span> �?accumulation of abnormal lysosomal substances in the serum![Pasted image 20250423104449.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250423104449.png)
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Coarse facial features</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Corneal clouding</span>: progresses to blindness
	- Gingival hyperplasia
	- Claw hand deformity
	- Kyphoscoliosis
	- Abnormal bone growth and restricted joint movements
	- Failure to thrive (growth failure by 2 years of age)
	- Developmental delay
- Diagnostics
	- Prenatal: low levels of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiesterase enzyme activity in amniotic fluid or chorionic villi
	- Postnatal
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased plasma levels of lysosomal enzymes</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inclusion bodies in peripheral blood lymphocytes (I-cells)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Note: negative urinary glycosaminoglycans (compared with mucopolysaccharidoses)</span>
