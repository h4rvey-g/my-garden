| Synthesizing Polymerase | Type of RNA Produced          | Function                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RNA polymerase I        | 18S, 5.8S & 28S ribosomal RNA | Forms essential ribosomal components                             |
| RNA polymerase II       | mRNA                          | Translated by ribosomes to form specific proteins                |
|                         | Small nuclear RNA             | Involved in mRNA splicing & transcription regulation             |
|                         | MicroRNA                      | Causes gene silencing via translation arrest or mRNA degradation |
| RNA polymerase III      | Transfer RNA                  | Adaptor molecule linking codons with specific amino acids        |
|                         | 5S ribosomal RNA              | Essential component of 60S ribosomal subunit                     |
