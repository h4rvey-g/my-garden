A fundamental concept in molecular biology is that **synthesis of new DNA and RNA strands always occurs in the 5' → 3' direction**. This means nucleotides are added to the 3'-hydroxyl (-OH) group of the growing strand. However, the enzymes read the template strand in the opposite direction.

## 5' → 3' Processes/Enzymes

This is the direction of **synthesis** for all new nucleic acid chains.

*   **DNA Polymerase (Replication)**
    *   **5' → 3' Polymerase Activity**: Synthesizes the new DNA strand by adding dNTPs to the 3' end. This is true for both the leading and lagging strands (Okazaki fragments).
    *   **5' → 3' Exonuclease Activity**: Found in **DNA Polymerase I** (prokaryotes). This activity is crucial for removing the RNA primers from the lagging strand and replacing them with DNA.

*   **RNA Polymerase (Transcription)**
    *   **5' → 3' Polymerase Activity**: Synthesizes the new mRNA strand using the DNA template. It adds ribonucleotides to the 3' end of the growing RNA molecule.

*   **Ribosome (Translation)**
    *   The ribosome reads the mRNA transcript in the **5' → 3' direction** to synthesize protein from the N-terminus to the C-terminus.

## 3' → 5' Processes/Enzymes

This directionality is associated with **reading the template strand** and **proofreading**.

*   **Template Strand Reading**
    *   **DNA Polymerase (Replication)**: Moves along the template strand in the **3' → 5' direction** to synthesize the new 5' → 3' strand.
    *   **RNA Polymerase (Transcription)**: Reads the DNA template (antisense) strand in the **3' → 5' direction** to create the complementary 5' → 3' mRNA transcript.

*   **Exonuclease (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Proofreading</span>) Activity**
    *   **3' → 5' Exonuclease Activity**: This is the **proofreading** function found in high-fidelity DNA polymerases (like DNA Pol I, II, and III in prokaryotes). If an incorrect nucleotide is added, the polymerase can back up and excise the mismatched base from the 3' end of the new strand before continuing synthesis. This significantly increases replication fidelity.
