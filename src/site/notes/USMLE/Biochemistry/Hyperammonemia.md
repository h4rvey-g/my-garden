- Normal intracranial ammonia physiology
	- Glutamate and ammonia exist in a chemical equilibrium with glutamine, mediated by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GABA is mainly synthesized from glutamate via the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase</span>

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated serum ammonia levels</span> disrupt the balance between glutamine, glutamate, α-ketoglutarate, and GABA through the actions of glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, resulting in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased glutamine and decreased glutamate levels �?low [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|GABA]] synthesis and GABAergic tone</span> �?typical features of hyperammonemic encephalopathy:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excess glutamine �?osmotic damage to [[USMLE/Neurology/Glial cells\|astrocytes]] �?cellular swelling and dysfunction �?cerebral edema</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Astrocytes' function is to remove excess neurotransmitters, i.e. converting glutamate (primary excitatory neurotransmitter) to glutamine</span>
		- Imbalance of the neurotransmitters �?Inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission and activation of inhibitory neurotransmission
	- Low α-ketoglutarate �?inhibition of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/TCA cycle\|TCA cycle]]
- Etiology
	- Hereditary: most often in children but heterozygotes can present as older children or adults
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Catabolism of amino acids\|Urea cycle]] disorders, especially ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency</span>
		- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Organic acidemias\|Organic acidemias]]: most commonly methylmalonic acidemia
