## Nucleotide excision repair
- **Mechanism:**
	- Specific <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">endonucleases</span> remove the oligonucleotides containing damaged bases.
	- DNA polymerase and ligase fill and reseal the gap, respectively.
	- Repairs bulky helix-distorting lesions (e.g., pyrimidine dimers).
- **When:**
	- Occurs in G₁ phase of cell cycle.
- **Clinical relevance:**
	- Defective in [[USMLE/MSK/Xeroderma pigmentosum\|xeroderma pigmentosum]] (inability to repair DNA pyrimidine dimers caused by UV exposure).
	- Presents with dry skin, photosensitivity, skin cancer.
## Base excision repair
- **Mechanism:**
	- Base-specific <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glycosylase</span> removes altered base and creates AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site.
	- AP-Endonuclease cleaves 5′ end, removing one or more nucleotides.
	- AP-Lyase cleaves 3′ end.
	- DNA Polymerase-β fills the gap.
	- DNA ligase seals it.
- **Mnemonic:**
	- "GEL Please."
- **When:**
	- Occurs throughout cell cycle.
- **Clinical relevance:**
	- Important in repair of spontaneous/toxic deamination.
## Mismatch repair
- **Mechanism:**
	- Mismatched nucleotides in newly synthesized strand are removed and gap is filled and resealed.
- **When:**
	- Occurs predominantly in S phase of cell cycle.
- **Clinical relevance:**
	- Defective in [[USMLE/GI/Lynch syndrome\|Lynch syndrome]].
