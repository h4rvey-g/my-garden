# Functions
![Pasted image 20231103105448.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231103105448.png)
- Vision: component of rhodopsin as 11-cis-retinal
- Gene transcription
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)</span> binds to its nuclear receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RAR; retinoid X receptors, RXR) → receptor dimerization → binding to DNA → uncoiling of chromatin → exposure of promoter regions of genes → binding of transcription factors to promoter → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">initiation of transcription and cell differentiation</span>
	- Regulation of various genes responsible for cell growth, cell differentiation, apoptosis, reproduction (e.g., spermatogenesis), and [[USMLE/Reproductive/Embryogenesis\|embryonic development]]
- Tissue maintenance and cell differentiation
	- Mainly retinoic acid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Promotes differentiation of epithelium into specialized tissue (e.g., pancreatic cells and goblet cells)</span>
	- Prevents metaplasia of squamous cells
- Antioxidant
# Vitamin A deficiency
## Causes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disorders associated with fat [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]]: inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Crohn disease\|Crohn disease]]), [[USMLE/GI/Celiac disease\|celiac disease]], [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|cystic fibrosis]], pancreatic insufficiency</span>
	- Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency → lack of digestive enzymes → [[USMLE/GI/Malabsorption\|malabsorption]] of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]]
## Clinical features
>[!tip] Triad of 
>- Night blindness
>- Dry eyes, Bitot spots
>- Hyperkeratosis

- Ocular manifestations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Night blindness (nyctalopia)</span>
	- Retinopathy
	- Xerophthalmia
	- Keratomalacia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bitot spots: gray, triangular, dry patches on the bulbar conjunctiva, covered by a layer with a foamy appearance </span>
		- Typical sign of vitamin A deficiency
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Caused by squamous cell metaplasia and keratinization of the conjunctiva</span>![Pasted image 20231103111548.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231103111548.png)
- Keratinizing squamous metaplasia of the bladder (pearl-like plaques on cystoscopy)
- Xerosis cutis
- Immunosuppression: Vitamin A deficiency increases the risk of a [[USMLE/MSK/Measles\|measles]] infection taking a severe course.
# Vitamin A toxicity
- Acute:  A single high dose can cause nausea, vomiting, [[USMLE/Neurology/Vertigo\|vertigo]], and blurred vision.
- Chronic (most common):  Long-term ingestion of excessive vitamin A can lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased intracranial pressure (ie, benign intracranial hypertension)</span>.  Other nonspecific symptoms include increased bone resorption (eg, [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]], fractures) as well as [[USMLE/MSK/Alopecia\|alopecia]] and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dry skin</span> and mucous membranes.  Because vitamin A is stored in the liver, hypervitaminosis A is hepatotoxic and can cause elevated aminotransferases, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/GI/Hepatomegaly\|hepatomegaly]]</span>, and liver fibrosis.
- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Teratogenesis\|Teratogenic]]:  Excessive first trimester intake can cause neural crest cell toxicity, resulting in fetal microcephaly, craniofacial defects, cardiac anomalies, and death.
