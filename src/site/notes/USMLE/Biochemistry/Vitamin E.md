# Vitamin E deficiency
- Deficiency is very rare.
- Vitamin E primarily serves as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">free radical scavenger to protect fatty acids from oxidation; deficiency predisposes cell membranes to oxidative injury.</span>  The cells that are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most susceptible include neurons with long axons (due to large membrane surface area) and erythrocytes (due to high oxygen exposure).</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurologic dysfunction</span>
		- Demyelination of the posterior column and spinocerebellar tract → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ proprioception and vibration sensation; ataxia (mimics [[USMLE/Neurology/Friedreich ataxia\|Friedreich ataxia]])</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurologic symptoms are similar to [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12 deficiency]], except that vitamin E deficiency does not lead to hypersegmented neutrophils, megaloblastic anemia, and increased methylmalonic acid levels. </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemolytic anemia: deficiency results in increased fragility of erythrocytes and membrane breakdown</span>
