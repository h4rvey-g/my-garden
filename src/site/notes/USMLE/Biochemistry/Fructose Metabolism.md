# Essential fructosuria
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased conversion of fructose to fructose-6-phosphate by hexokinase (hexokinase becomes the main pathway for turning fructose to fructose-6-phosphate)</span>
- Unphosphorylated fructose does not get trapped in cells �?remaining excess fructose �?excretion of fructose in urine

# Hereditary fructose intolerance
- Accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decrease in available phosphates</span> �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibition of glycogenolysis and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Gluconeogenesis\|gluconeogenesis]]</span>  �?[[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]] 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Phosphates are trapped in F-1-P, can't be used in elsewhere</span>
- Clinical features
	- Symptoms begin when the child is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weaned off breast milk and starts consuming food that contains sucrose (e.g., fruit, juice, honey)</span>
		- Fructose are like poisonous to them
	- Bloating, sweating, vomiting
	- Failure to thrive
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Jaundice (can progress to [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]])</span>
	- Bleeding tendency
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Severe [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]]: seizures, hypotonia, poor feeding, cyanosis, irritability</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/GI/Hepatomegaly\|Hepatomegaly]]</span>
- Treatment: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lifelong adherence to a fructose-free, sorbitol-free, and sucrose-free diet</span>
	- Some of the ingested sorbitol gets broken down into fructose during digestion.
	- Sucrose, also known as table sugar, is a disaccharide sugar molecule. It's made up of two simpler sugars: fructose and glucose.
