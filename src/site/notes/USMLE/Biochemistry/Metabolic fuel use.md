Fructose bisphosphatase-2 (FBPase-2) and phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2) are the same bifunctional enzyme whose function is reversed by phosphorylation by protein kinase A.

# Enzymes Increased in Fed State (High Insulin:Glucagon Ratio)
---
The fed state focuses on using and storing incoming fuel (anabolism). Insulin is the dominant hormone.

- **Glycolysis & Glucose Uptake (Energy Production & Storage Precursors):**
    
    - **Glucokinase (Liver) / Hexokinase (Most Tissues):** Traps glucose in the cell by phosphorylating it to glucose-6-phosphate. Glucokinase in the liver is induced by insulin.
    - **Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1):** The rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Activated by **fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP)**.
    - **Phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2):** Activated by insulin. PFK-2 produces F-2,6-BP, which strongly activates PFK-1, pushing glycolysis forward.
    - **Pyruvate Kinase:** Catalyzes the final, irreversible step of glycolysis.
- **Glycogen Synthesis (Glucose Storage):**
    
    - **Glycogen Synthase:** The rate-limiting enzyme for glycogenesis. Activated by insulin-mediated dephosphorylation.
- **Fatty Acid & Triglyceride Synthesis (Fat Storage):**
    
    - **Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC):** The rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis. Activated by insulin and citrate.
    - **Fatty Acid Synthase:** Synthesizes fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA.
    - **Lipoprotein Lipase (LPL):** Found on endothelial cells; breaks down triglycerides from chylomicrons and VLDL for uptake into adipose tissue and muscle. Activated by insulin.

# Enzymes Increased in Fasting State (Low Insulin:Glucagon Ratio)
---
The fasting state focuses on mobilizing stored fuel to maintain blood glucose for the brain and RBCs (catabolism). Glucagon and epinephrine are the dominant hormones.

- **Glycogenolysis (Glucose Release from Storage):**
    
    - **Glycogen Phosphorylase:** The rate-limiting enzyme of glycogenolysis. Activated by glucagon and epinephrine via a cAMP-mediated cascade.
- **Gluconeogenesis (New Glucose Synthesis):**
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Pyruvate Carboxylase:** Converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Activated by acetyl-CoA.</span>
    - **Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (PEPCK):** Converts oxaloacetate to PEP. Upregulated by glucagon and cortisol.
    - **Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase:** Bypasses PFK-1 in glycolysis. Inhibited by F-2,6-BP.
    - **Glucose-6-phosphatase:** Found only in the liver; dephosphorylates G6P to release free glucose into the blood.
- **Lipolysis & [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Fatty acid oxidation\|Fatty Acid Oxidation]] (Fat Breakdown for Energy):**
    
    - **Hormone-Sensitive Lipase (HSL):** Breaks down stored triglycerides in adipocytes into free fatty acids and glycerol. Activated by glucagon and epinephrine; inhibited by insulin.
    - **Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-I):** Rate-limiting enzyme for β-oxidation; transports fatty acids into the mitochondria.
- **Ketogenesis (Alternate Fuel Production):**
    
    - **HMG-CoA Synthase:** Rate-limiting enzyme for ketone body synthesis in the liver mitochondria.
    - **HMG-CoA Lyase:** Produces acetoacetate from HMG-CoA.
