# Primary substrates
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucogenic [[USMLE/REVIEW/Amino acids\|amino acids]]</span>: Generated from the hydrolysis of protein tissue (typically during [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use\|fasting]] > 1 week), these [[USMLE/REVIEW/Amino acids\|amino acids]] are capable of being converted to α-keto acids (e.g., oxaloacetate, α-ketoglutarate) and then to glucose. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lactate</span>: Via the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Catabolism of amino acids\|Cori cycle]], lactate produced from anaerobic [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Glycolysis\|glycolysis]] (mostly in skeletal muscle) is shuttled to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvate, which serves as the first true substrate in gluconeogenesis.
- Propionyl-CoA
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Formed from odd-chain fatty acid [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Fatty acid oxidation\|β-oxidation]]</span>, this molecule can be carboxylated to form succinyl-CoA. Succinyl-CoA can enter the gluconeogenesis pathway after being converted to oxaloacetate via the [[USMLE/Biochemistry/TCA cycle\|TCA cycle]].
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Even-chain fatty acids can only be oxidized to acetyl-CoA, so they cannot be used for gluconeogenesis. </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glycerol 3-phosphate:</span>
	1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Released into the blood during hydrolysis of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue</span>![Pasted image 20240302103109.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240302103109.png)
	2. Phosphorylated by glycerol kinase in the liver
	3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oxidized by glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (an intermediate of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Glycolysis\|glycolysis]])</span>
