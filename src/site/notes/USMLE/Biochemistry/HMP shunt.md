# Key Functions & Purpose
1.  **Produce NADPH:** Used for:
    *   **Reductive Biosynthesis:** Fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol/steroid synthesis, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">part of [[USMLE/Immunology/Respiratory burst\|Respiratory burst]]</span>
    *   **Antioxidant Defense:** Essential for regenerating reduced glutathione, which detoxifies reactive oxygen species (e.g., H₂O₂). This is particularly crucial in RBCs.
2.  **Produce Ribose-5-Phosphate (R5P):** A precursor for nucleotide (DNA, RNA) and coenzyme (NAD+, FAD, CoA) synthesis.

# Pathway Phases

1.  **Oxidative Phase (Irreversible)**
    *   **Purpose:** Generates **2 NADPH** from one molecule of Glucose-6-Phosphate (G6P).
    *   **Rate-Limiting Enzyme:** **Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD)**.
        *   Converts G6P to 6-phosphogluconolactone.
        *   **Induced by:** NADP+, Insulin.
        *   **Inhibited by:** NADPH (product inhibition).
    *   **Location:** Tissues with high demand for NADPH (e.g., liver, adrenal cortex, lactating mammary glands, RBCs).

2.  **Non-Oxidative Phase (Reversible)**
    *   **Purpose:** Interconverts ribulose-5-phosphate (product of oxidative phase) into **ribose-5-phosphate** (for nucleotide synthesis) or glycolytic intermediates (Fructose-6-P, Glyceraldehyde-3-P). This allows the pathway to be flexible based on the cell's metabolic needs.
    *   **Key Enzymes:**
        *   **Transketolase:** Requires **Thiamine (Vitamin B1)** as a cofactor. Transfers 2-carbon units.
        *   **Transaldolase:** Transfers 3-carbon units.
