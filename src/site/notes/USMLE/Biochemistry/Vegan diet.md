*   **Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin):**
    *   **Source:** Found almost exclusively in animal products. Deficiency is a major concern. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">But it takes years.</span>
	    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Instead folate is rich in many vegetables, hence it's called 叶酸</span>
    *   **Presentation:** Megaloblastic anemia, peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias), subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (loss of proprioception/vibration sense), glossitis, dementia.
    *   **Mgmt:** **Must supplement** with oral B12 or consume fortified foods (e.g., fortified cereals, plant milks).
*   **Iron:**
    *   **Source:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Plant-based iron is non-heme iron, which has lower bioavailability than heme iron from meat.</span>
    *   **Presentation:** Microcytic anemia (fatigue, pallor, koilonychia).
    *   **Mgmt:** Consume iron-rich plant foods (lentils, tofu, spinach, fortified cereals) with a source of **vitamin C** to enhance absorption. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Menstruating women are at higher risk.</span>
*   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Calcium & Vitamin D:**</span>
    *   **Source:** Dairy is a major source of both. Plant sources of calcium include fortified plant milks, tofu, and leafy greens (e.g., kale). Vitamin D is primarily from sun exposure and fortified foods.
    *   **Presentation:** ↑ risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures.
    *   **Mgmt:** Ensure adequate intake of calcium-rich/fortified foods. Vitamin D supplementation is often necessary, especially in regions with limited sun.
*   **Omega-3 Fatty Acids (DHA/EPA):**
    *   **Source:** Primarily from fatty fish. Plant sources (flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds) provide ALA, but conversion to DHA/EPA is inefficient.
    *   **Relevance:** Important for brain and cardiovascular health.
    *   **Mgmt:** Consider algal oil supplements for a direct source of DHA/EPA.
*   **Protein:**
    *   **Source:** Plant proteins can be less digestible and may be "incomplete" (lacking one or more essential amino acids).
    *   **Mgmt:** Requires eating a **variety** of protein sources (e.g., legumes, grains, soy products, nuts, seeds) to ensure a complete amino acid profile.
