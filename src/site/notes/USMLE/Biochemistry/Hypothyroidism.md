# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary hypothyroidism: insufficient thyroid hormone production</span>
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hashimoto thyroiditis\|Hashimoto thyroiditis]]
		- The most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions
		- Associated with [[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-DR3]] and other autoimmune diseases (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Vitiligo\|vitiligo]], pernicious anemia, type 1 [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]], and [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]])
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis\|Postpartum thyroiditis]] ([[USMLE/Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis\|subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis]]) 
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis\|De Quervain thyroiditis]] ([[USMLE/Endocrine/Subacute thyroiditis\|subacute granulomatous thyroiditis]]): often subsequent to a flu-like illness
	- Iatrogenic: e.g., post thyroidectomy, radioiodine therapy, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">antithyroid medication (e.g., amiodarone, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Lithium\|lithium]])</span>
	- Nutritional (insufficient intake of iodine): the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, particularly in iodine-deficient regions
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Riedel thyroiditis\|Riedel thyroiditis]]: occurs in IgG4-related systemic disease
	- Wolff-Chaikoff effect
	- Thyroid dysplasia: a disorder of embryologic development characterized by abnormal development and/or location of thyroid tissue (e.g., lingual thyroid)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Secondary hypothyroidism: pituitary disorders (e.g., [[USMLE/Endocrine/Pituitary adenoma\|pituitary adenoma]]) → TSH deficiency</span>
- Tertiary hypothyroidism: hypothalamic disorders → TRH deficiency

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Symptoms related to decreased metabolic rate
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hair loss (Queen Anne sign), brittle nails, and cold, dry skin</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight gain (despite poor appetite)</span>
- Symptoms related to generalized myxedema
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hoarse voice, difficulty articulating words</span>
- Symptoms of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia\|hyperprolactinemia]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal menstrual cycle (esp. secondary [[USMLE/Reproductive/Amenorrhea\|amenorrhea]] or menorrhagia)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Galactorrhea </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased libido</span>, erectile dysfunction, delayed ejaculation, and infertility in men

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">TSH: Best initial screening test</span>
	- Thyroid hormone suppresses TSH and TRH via negative feedback, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small changes in thyroid hormone levels lead to large changes in TSH levels.</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">As thyroid hormone production slows, TSH secretion increases rapidly to restore thyroid activity, often before T4 levels fall below standard laboratory reference ranges.</span>
- FT<sub>4</sub>: Confirmatory test for primary hypothyroidism if TSH is elevated

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In subclinical hypothyroidism, rhe pituitary gland increases TSH secretion, which stimulates the remaining thyroid tissue to produce sufficient hormones.</span> Patients develop overt hypothyroidism when this mode of compensation is no longer sufficient.
# Treatment
---
Hypothyroidism is treated with lifelong hormone substitution.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Levothyroxine: synthetic form of T4</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line choice</span> for the treatment of hypothyroidism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripherally converted to T3</span> (biologically active metabolite) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rT3 (biologically inactive metabolite)</span>
		- In patients with severe [[USMLE/Endocrine/Euthyroid sick syndrome\|Euthyroid Sick Syndrome]], aka non-thyroidal illnesses (like sepsis or major trauma), rT3 levels often rise while active T3 levels fall, even if TSH is normal or low.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liothyronine: synthetic form of T3</span>
	- Part of the treatment for myxedema coma
	- Not recommended as monotherapy or in combination with levothyroxine for the long-term treatment of hypothyroidism
		- Liothyronine has a short half-life and requires three to four daily doses, making it less suitable than levothyroxine for the ongoing treatment of hypothyroidism.

# Congenital hypothyroidism
## Clinical features
- Asymptomatic at birth
- Symptomatic weeks to months after birth (as maternal T4 wanes)
	- Hypometabolism: ↓ HR & temperature, lethargy/poor feeding, hypotonia, [[USMLE/GI/Constipation\|constipation]], jaundice
	- Mucopolysaccharide accumulation: macroglossia, umbilical hernia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cretinism</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Nonpitting edema\|Nonpitting edema]] (eg, "puffy" face), umbilical hernia, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle</span>
		- Due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally</span>

>[!warning] 
>Most children with congenital hypothyroidism <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">do not have symptoms at the time of birth because the placenta supplies the fetus with maternal thyroid hormone.</span> For this reason, neonatal screening is vital even if children are asymptomatic. Irreversible intellectual disabilities can be avoided through early initiation of adequate therapy!

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neonatal screening to measure TSH levels</span> 24–48 hours after birth is required by law.
- Increased TSH levels indicate congenital hypothyroidism.
