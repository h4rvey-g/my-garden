Definition: A group of disorders characterized by an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired energy production that mainly affects organs with a high energy requirement (e.g., brain).</span>
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
Caused by defects in mitochondrial DNA, which are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">maternally inherited</span>
- Children of an affected mother will likewise be affected.
- Genetic expression is variable due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">heteroplasmy.</span>

# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired oxidative phosphorylation → decreased production of energy in mitochondria (lack of ATP) → up-regulation of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Glycolysis\|glycolysis]] → overproduction of pyruvate → accumulation of lactate and alanine </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Organs with a high energy requirement (e.g., retina, brain, inner ear, skeletal, cardiac muscles) are particularly affected.</span>

# Clinical features
- Commonly external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and/or exertional muscle weakness.
## Subtypes of mitochondrial myopathies 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MELAS</span>: characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy, Lactic Acidosis, recurring Stroke-like episodes </span>
	- Other findings include
		- Muscle weakness
		- Tonic-clonic [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]]

# Diagnostics
- Genetic studies (including mitochondrial DNA)
- Muscle biopsy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunohistochemistry typically shows ragged red fibers, which are caused by subsarcolemmal and intermyofibrillar accumulation of defective mitochondria in muscles (mitochondria stain red).</span> ![Pasted image 20231114165141.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231114165141.png)
- Laboratory studies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal CK</span> 
		- Mitochondrial myopathies often cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which can lead to muscle weakness without significant muscle fiber death.
	- Elevated lactate and alanine in serum, urine and/or [[USMLE/Neurology/Cerebrospinal fluid analysis\|CSF]] → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">lactic acidosis</span>
