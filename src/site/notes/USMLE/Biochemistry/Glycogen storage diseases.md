# Von Gierke disease
![Pasted image 20231114171252.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231114171252.png)
- Hepatomegaly and Renomegaly:
	- Glucose-6-phosphate cannot be converted to glucose, so it accumulates in liver and kidney cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This excess G6P gets converted to glycogen, which builds up in these organs</span>
	- The chronic accumulation causes organ enlargement and can lead to hepatic adenomas over time
- The other symptoms occur because the body can't access glucose properly:
# Cori disease
![Pasted image 20231114172027.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231114172027.png)<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal glycogen branch like coral.</span>
- Clinical presentation is similar to that of type I, though symptoms tend to be less severe.
- Generalized muscle weakness and/or cramps
- Possibly cirrhosis (ascites, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly)
- Mild, fasting hypoglycemia and ketosis
- Hyperlipidemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cytosolic accumulations of limit dextrin-like complexes</span>
- Blood lactate levels are normal.
- Gluconeogenesis is functional.
- Type III may result in cardiomyopathy.
# McArdle disease & Hers disease

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flat venous lactate curve with exaggerated elevations in blood ammonia during exercise</span>
	- No glucose, can't produce lactate
	- Increased protein and amino acid Metabolism

# Pompe disease
![Pasted image 20231114173104.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231114173104.png)
- This condition is caused by deficiency of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acid alpha-glucosidase (alpha-1,4 glucosidase or acid maltase)</span>, an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen within the acidic environment of lysosomes.
- Although most glycogen is degraded in the cytoplasm,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> a small percentage is inadvertently engulfed by lysosomes</span>, especially in cells containing high amounts of glycogen such as hepatocytes and myocytes. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> Deficiency of acid maltase results in pathologic accumulation of glycogen within liver and muscle lysosomes.  Cardiac and skeletal muscle are particularly susceptible because the ballooning lysosomes interfere with contractile function.</span>
