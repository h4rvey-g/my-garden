# Type I: Von Gierke Disease
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** Deficient **Glucose-6-Phosphatase**. This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impairs both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis</span>, preventing the liver from releasing free glucose into the blood.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Presents in infancy (3-6 months) with a doll-like face, thin extremities, and a protuberant abdomen (due to massive hepatomegaly).
    *   **Severe fasting hypoglycemia** is a hallmark, often leading to seizures.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Labs:** ↑ Lactate (lactic acidosis), ↑ uric acid (gout), ↑ triglycerides/hyperlipidemia.
    *   Glucagon challenge test: Blood glucose fails to rise.
*   **Management:** Frequent oral glucose/cornstarch feedings, avoidance of fructose and galactose.

# Type II: Pompe Disease
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** Deficient lysosomal **α-1,4-glucosidase (acid maltase)**. Glycogen accumulates in lysosomes, leading to cellular damage. Pompe **P**umps the heart.
	* **Pompe Disease is the ONLY Glycogen Storage Disease that is also a Lysosomal Storage Disease.**
*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Classic Infantile form:** Presents in early infancy with cardiomegaly (often hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), profound muscular hypotonia ("floppy baby"), feeding difficulties, and macroglossia. Death often occurs from cardiorespiratory failure.
    *   Normal blood glucose levels.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Enzyme assay showing deficient acid maltase activity.
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PAS stain shows glycogen accumulation within lysosomes.</span>
    *   ↑ CK and LDH levels.
*   **Management:** Enzyme replacement therapy.

# Type III: Cori Disease
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** Deficient **debranching enzyme (α-1,6-glucosidase)**. Glycogenolysis is incomplete, resulting in the accumulation of limit dextrin-like structures.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A **milder version of Von Gierke disease**.</span>
    *   Presents with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, and short stature.
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Gluconeogenesis is intact**, so lactic acid and uric acid levels are usually **normal**.</span>
    *   Skeletal and cardiac muscle involvement can occur.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Normal blood lactate levels distinguish it from Von Gierke.
    *   Biopsy shows glycogen with abnormally short outer branches.
*   **Management:** High-protein diet to support gluconeogenesis.

# Type V: McArdle Disease
*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** Deficient skeletal **muscle glycogen phosphorylase (myophosphorylase)**. This prevents the breakdown of glycogen in muscles for energy. **M**cArdle = **M**uscle.
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Presents in adolescence or early adulthood.
    *   **Exercise intolerance**, painful muscle cramps, and fatigue, especially with strenuous activity.
    *   **Myoglobinuria** (reddish-brown urine) after exercise.
    *   "**Second wind**" phenomenon: Symptoms improve with rest or continued exercise at a lower intensity as blood flow increases, delivering glucose and fatty acids.
*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Flat venous lactate curve** during forearm exercise test (no rise in lactate), with a normal rise in ammonia.
    *   Blood glucose levels are typically unaffected.
    *   ↑ CK during episodes.
*   **Management:** Avoidance of strenuous exercise. Consuming simple carbohydrates before exercise can be beneficial.
# Von Gierke disease

- Hepatomegaly and Renomegaly:
	- Glucose-6-phosphate cannot be converted to glucose, so it accumulates in liver and kidney cells
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This excess G6P gets converted to glycogen, which builds up in these organs</span>
	- The chronic accumulation causes organ enlargement and can lead to hepatic adenomas over time
- The other symptoms occur because the body can't access glucose properly:
# Cori disease

- Clinical presentation is similar to that of type I, though symptoms tend to be less severe.
- Generalized muscle weakness and/or cramps
- Possibly cirrhosis (ascites, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly)
- Mild, fasting hypoglycemia and ketosis
- Hyperlipidemia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cytosolic accumulations of limit dextrin-like complexes</span>
- Blood lactate levels are normal.
- Gluconeogenesis is functional.
- Type III may result in cardiomyopathy.

# Pompe disease
![Pasted image 20231114173104.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231114173104.png)
- This condition is caused by deficiency of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acid alpha-glucosidase (alpha-1,4 glucosidase or acid maltase)</span>, an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen within the acidic environment of lysosomes.
- Although most glycogen is degraded in the cytoplasm,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> a small percentage is inadvertently engulfed by lysosomes</span>, especially in cells containing high amounts of glycogen such as hepatocytes and myocytes. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> Deficiency of acid maltase results in pathologic accumulation of glycogen within liver and muscle lysosomes.  Cardiac and skeletal muscle are particularly susceptible because the ballooning lysosomes interfere with contractile function.</span>
