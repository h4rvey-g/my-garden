# Extracellular matrix fibers (connective tissue fibers)

Collagen fibers, Reticular fibers, and Elastic fibers
## Collagen
---
### Structure
- A collagen molecule is a protein with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repeating amino acid sequence (Gly-X-Y)<sub>n</sub>.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The first amino acid of this triplet is glycine (collagen is comprised of ⅓ glycine).</span>
	- Position X: most commonly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">proline</span> (also common: lysine, hydroxylysine)
	- Position Y: most commonly <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydroxyproline</span> (also common: hydroxylysine, lysine)
### Types

>[!tip]
>- Compare with ligaments, which are made of elastin.
>- Ligaments attach bone to bone, and tendons attach muscle to bone.
>- Connect presence of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">elastin with [[USMLE/Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome\|Marfan syndrome]]</span>
>	- FBN1 can disrupt the normal regulation of TGF-β -> Tall stature
>	- Skin -> Skin hyperextensibility
>	- Large arteries -> aortic dilation, aneurysms, or dissection
>	- Elastic ligaments -> Joint hypermobility
>	- Lung -> Increased risk of spontaneous [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumothorax\|pneumothorax]]

# Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)
---
- Definition: a family of unbranched polysaccharide chains of repeating disaccharide units with multiple negative charges that constitute a large volume fraction of the ECM 
- Structure: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">polymer of repeating disaccharide units</span>
- Four main groups 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyaluronic acid</span>
	- Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate
	- Heparan sulfate
	- Keratan sulfate
- Function
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bind H2O in connective tissue due to its negative charges: act as a cushion</span> 
	- Component of proteoglycans 
# Proteoglycans
---
- Definition: proteins with numerous covalently linked GAG side chains 
- Function
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bind H2O → shock absorption and a supportive function (e.g., in cartilage → resistance to compression of articular cartilage)</span>
	- Formation of cell-cell junction or cell-matrix junction 
	- Further signaling and regulatory functions (e.g., by binding signaling molecules)
- Examples
	- Aggrecan: large proteoglycan found in cartilage as an aggregate with hyaluronic acid → shock absorption withstands compression
	- Decorin: small proteoglycan that binds collagen fibrils → regulates fibril assembly
# Glycoproteins of the ECM
---
- Definition: proteins with short carbohydrate side chains that contribute to the organization of the extracellular matrix by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">offering specific binding sites</span> for cells and other matrix molecules
- Examples
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibronectin</span>
		- Glycoprotein important for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cell-matrix interactions</span>
		- Function: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">binds to collagen and integrins</span> and plays an important role in [[USMLE/Reproductive/Embryogenesis\|embryogenesis]] (regulates cell migration) and hemostasis (cross-linking of fibrin molecules with thrombocytes and fibroblasts)
	- Laminin
		- Major component and organizer of the basal lamina (besides type IV collagen)
		- Function: binds to collagens, integrins, and proteoglycans
