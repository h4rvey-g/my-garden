- Definition: a rare inherited genetic disorder that is characterized by an elevation of orotic acid in the serum and urine due to defective UMP synthase
- Inheritance: autosomal recessive 
- Pathophysiology
	- UMP synthase normally converts orotic acid into uridine monophosphate. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deficiency of UMP synthase → accumulation of orotic acid in serum and urine</span>
	- Defective de novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides
- Clinical features
	- Manifests in early childhood
	- Growth faltering
	- Delayed physical and mental development
	- Megaloblastic anemia, which does not respond to folate and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]] supplementation
	- Orotic acid crystalluria
- Diagnostics 
	- Serum
		- ↓ [[USMLE/Blood/Hemoglobin variants\|Hemoglobin]]
		- ↑ Mean corpuscular volume
		- ↑ Orotic acid
		- Normal ammonia levels and BUN
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urine: ↑ orotic acid</span>
- Treatment 
	- Uridine monophosphate substitution
	- Uridine triacetate substitution
