- Dietary lipids: TAGs, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters
	- Not readily absorbed by enterocytes due to:
		- Hydrophobic properties
		- Large molecular size
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First broken down by lipases in the mouth, stomach, and intestinal lumen and packaged into micelles</span>
	- Micelles 
		- A spherical-shaped aggregation of surfactant molecules in a colloid
		- Composed of an outer layer of hydrophilic (polar) heads and an inner hydrophobic (nonpolar) core 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enclose lipids and fat-soluble vitamins, forming a package</span>
		- Readily absorbed by the membranes of enterocytes �?deliver internal contents to the cell
- Bile release: Once a lipid enters the intestinal lumen, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bile is secreted into the lumen to emulsify the lipid contents.</span>
	- Emulsify: **mechanically disrupt** these large fat globules into **smaller droplets**, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increasing the **surface area** exposed to digestive enzymes like pancreatic lipase.</span>
- Pancreas secretion: The pancreas secretes pancreatic lipase, colipase, and cholesterol esterase, which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydrolyze the lipid into cholesterol, fatty acids, and 2-monoglyceride molecules.</span>
- Absorption of short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids: pass the enterocytes �?released to the hepatic portal vein �?liver �?enter the general circulation and bind albumin
