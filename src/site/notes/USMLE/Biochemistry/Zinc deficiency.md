# Zinc function
---
- Protein structure
	- Forms bonds between cysteine and histidine
	- Forms zinc finger transcription factors
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Zinc finger: a type of DNA-binding domain, binded by transcription factors</span>
			- Characteristics: zinc ion coordinated by two histidine and two cysteine residues
			- DNA binding: Several zinc finger domains are often connected as a chain and bind to an Î±-helix in the major groove of DNA.
- Aids in maintenance and stability of the nuclear membrane
- Essential part of many enzymes (> 100), including DNA polymerase, carbonic anhydrase, ACE, [[USMLE/Blood/Alkaline phosphatase\|alkaline phosphatase]], metallothionein, superoxide dismutase, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">collagenases</span>
# Zinc deficiency
- Causes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inadequate dietary intake</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acrodermatitis enteropathica: congenital deficiency of the zinc/iron-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP)  </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Malabsorption (e.g., due to Crohn disease)</span>, liver, and renal disease
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Total parenteral nutrition</span> (TPN)
	- Chronic liver disease (esp. liver cirrhosis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bowel resection</span>
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired wound healing</span>
		- Inability to replace type III collagen with type I collagen
	- Dysgeusia
		- On the upper surface of the tongue, there are taste receptor cells known as "taste buds". These cells regenerate frequently but the activity reduces when zinc is deficient, which causes dysgeusia.
	- Anosmia
	- Immune dysfunction
	- Male hypogonadism
	- Dermatitis
		- Perioral (a) and perianal (b) erythema and pustules can be seen.![Pasted image 20231013204734.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231013204734.png)
	- [[USMLE/MSK/Alopecia\|Alopecia]]
	- In patients with liver cirrhosis: associated with accelerated progression of cirrhosis and aggravated clinical symptoms (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy)
	- Diarrhea
	- Impaired growth and development
- Diagnosis: measurement of plasma zinc levels
- Treatment: oral zinc supplementation
