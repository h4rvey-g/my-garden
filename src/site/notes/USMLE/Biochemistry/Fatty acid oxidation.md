# Pathophysiology/Etiology

*   **Function:** Breaks down fatty acids (FAs) into acetyl-CoA, generating NADH and FADH₂. This is a crucial energy source during fasting, starvation, and prolonged exercise, especially for the heart and skeletal muscle.
*   **Location:** Primarily in the **mitochondrial matrix**.
*   **Process Overview:** A cyclical process that sequentially cleaves two-carbon units (as acetyl-CoA) from the fatty acyl-CoA molecule.

## Key Steps:
![Pasted image 20231124112605.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231124112605.png)
1.  **Activation:** In the cytoplasm, long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are activated to fatty acyl-CoA by **fatty acyl-CoA synthetase**, requiring ATP.
2.  **Transport (Rate-Limiting Step):** LCFAs require the **carnitine shuttle** to enter the mitochondria.
    *   **CPT1 (Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase I):** Fatty acyl-CoA is converted to acylcarnitine on the outer mitochondrial membrane. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Inhibited by Malonyl-CoA** (an intermediate in FA synthesis).</span>
    *   **Translocase:** Acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix.
    *   **CPT2 (Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase II):** Acylcarnitine is converted back to fatty acyl-CoA in the matrix.
    *   *Note:* Short and medium-chain FAs do not require the carnitine shuttle.
3.  **β-Oxidation Spiral:** In the mitochondrial matrix, a four-reaction sequence is repeated:
    *   **Oxidation** by acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">produces FADH₂</span>).
    *   **Hydration**.
    *   **Oxidation** by β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">produces NADH</span>).
    *   **Thiolysis** (cleavage) to release acetyl-CoA and a fatty acyl-CoA that is two carbons shorter.
*   **Fates of Acetyl-CoA:**
    *   Enters the **TCA cycle** in muscle and other tissues for ATP production.
    *   Used for **ketone body synthesis** in the liver, especially during fasting.

# Clinical Presentation of Defects

*   Disorders typically present during periods of catabolic stress (e.g., fasting, illness, prolonged exercise).
*   Classic presentation: **Hypoketotic hypoglycemia**. The hypoglycemia occurs because gluconeogenesis requires ATP and NADH, which are supplied by β-oxidation. Without β-oxidation, gluconeogenesis is impaired. Ketone body production is also deficient.
*   Other common symptoms include lethargy, vomiting, seizures, coma, hyperammonemia, and myopathy.

# Key Disorders

## Carnitine Shuttle Defects

*   **Primary Carnitine Deficiency:** Defect in the carnitine transporter.
    *   **Dx:** Low plasma carnitine levels, reduced carnitine uptake by cells.
    *   **Presentation:** Weakness, hypotonia, cardiomyopathy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia.
*   **Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I Deficiency:** Affects the liver.
    *   **Dx:** Elevated plasma carnitine, acylcarnitine profile shows ↑ free carnitine.
    *   **Presentation:** Primarily hepatic symptoms with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and risk of liver failure.
*   **Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II Deficiency:** Most common inherited disorder of lipid metabolism in adults.
    *   **Dx:** Acylcarnitine profile shows elevated C16, C18:1 acylcarnitines during an attack.
    *   **Presentation:** Classic adult form involves myalgia, muscle weakness, and **myoglobinuria** (red-brown urine) triggered by prolonged exercise, fasting, or illness.

## Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiencies

*   **Medium-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (MCAD) Deficiency:** Most common inborn error of FA oxidation.
    *   **Dx:** Elevated **C8-C10 acylcarnitines** in plasma, dicarboxylic acids in urine. Now part of newborn screening.
    *   **Presentation:** Presents in infancy or early childhood. Vomiting, lethargy, seizures, coma, liver dysfunction, **hypoketotic hypoglycemia** following a period of fasting (e.g., viral illness).
*   **Very Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase (VLCAD) Deficiency:**
    *   **Dx:** Elevated C14-C18 acylcarnitines.
    *   **Presentation:** Can present with severe cardiomyopathy in infancy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, or later-onset myopathy.

# Management/Treatment

*   **Acute:** IV dextrose to correct hypoglycemia and reverse catabolism.
*   **Long-term:**
    *   Avoid fasting and prolonged exercise.
    *   Provide frequent meals with a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet.
    *   **Carnitine supplementation** for carnitine deficiencies.
    *   **Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil** can be used as a supplement in LCHAD/VLCAD deficiency, as MCTs bypass the carnitine shuttle.

# Key Associations/Buzzwords

*   **Buzzwords:** Hypoketotic hypoglycemia, myoglobinuria after exercise, dicarboxylic aciduria.
*   **Jamaican Vomiting Sickness:** Caused by eating unripe ackee fruit, which contains **hypoglycin A**. This toxin irreversibly inhibits MCAD, leading to symptoms mimicking MCAD deficiency.
*   **Odd-Chain Fatty Acids:** Undergo β-oxidation to yield acetyl-CoA and one molecule of **propionyl-CoA**. Propionyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle after being converted to succinyl-CoA.
*   **Peroxisomal Oxidation:** Very-long-chain fatty acids (>20 carbons) are initially oxidized in peroxisomes. Defects lead to conditions like **Zellweger syndrome** or **X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy**.
