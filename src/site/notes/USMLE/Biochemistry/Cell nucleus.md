# Structure
---
- Nuclear content
	- Chromatin: complex of DNA, histones, and nonhistone proteins
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nucleolus: site of rRNA synthesis and ribosomal subunit assembly</span>

# Functions
---
- Storage of the entire genetic information of an organism in the form of chromatin (except mitochondrial DNA)
- Duplication of genetic information before cell division (DNA replication): See the cell cycle for further information.
- Transcription: initial step of protein synthesis
- Synthesis of rRNA in the nucleolus
- Packaging and protection of inactive DNA by histones
