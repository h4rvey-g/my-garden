- Definition: inherited genetic disorders characterized by impaired metabolism of fats and proteins
- Pathophysiology![Pasted image 20241029162629.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241029162629.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Propionic acidemia: propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency �?impaired conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA �?�?propionyl-CoA and �?methylmalonate �?conversion into propionic acid, which accumulates in serum and urine</span>
	- Methylmalonic acidemia: methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency or [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12 deficiency]] �?accumulation of methylmalonic acid
		- Methylmalonyl-CoA is transformed into succinyl-CoA by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which requires adenosylcobalamin, the active form of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]], as a cofactor.
	- Accumulation of organic acids leads to
		- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Catabolism of amino acids\|Catabolism of amino acids]] inhibition �?[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hyperammonemia\|hyperammonemia]]
		- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Gluconeogenesis\|Gluconeogenesis]] inhibition �?[[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]] during [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use\|fasting]] periods and increased risk of ketoacidosis (high anion gap metabolic acidosis)
- Clinical features
	- Most commonly present in infancy with poor feeding, vomiting, hypotonia, high anion gap metabolic acidosis, [[USMLE/GI/Hepatomegaly\|hepatomegaly]], [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]].
