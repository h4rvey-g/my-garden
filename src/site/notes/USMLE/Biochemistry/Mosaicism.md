- Mosaicism: the presence of two or more populations of cells within an organism, each with a different genetic composition![L27481.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L27481.jpg)
	- Somatic mosaicism affects the cells forming the body, causing disease manifestations to develop in affected individuals.  45,X/46,XX is the most commonly diagnosed mosaicism affecting sex chromosomes.  These patients typically have a milder form of [[USMLE/Reproductive/Differences (disorders) of sex development\|Turner syndrome]] or can be asymptomatic, depending on the ratio of abnormal to normal cells.
		- Example: [[USMLE/Reproductive/McCune-Albright syndrome\|McCune-Albright syndrome]]
	- Germline mosaicism affects the cells that give rise to gametes, allowing the affected genes to pass to the offspring.  The chance of a child being affected depends on the proportion of gametes that carry the mutation.  When mosaicism is limited to the germline, the affected parent does not develop clinical manifestations.
