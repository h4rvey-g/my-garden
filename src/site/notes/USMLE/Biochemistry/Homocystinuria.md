## Folate cycle
1. (Folic acid to THF, see [[USMLE/Biochemistry/De novo pyrimidine and purine synthesis\|Folic acid pathway]])
2. **THF** (empty carrier)
3. **THF** picks up a **methylene** group (from serine, glycine, etc.) → forms **5,10-methylene THF** (has a “methylene” group **bridging the N5 and N10 positions** of the THF molecule.)
4. **5,10-methylene THF** is _reduced_ to **5-methyl THF** (now with a methyl group at one site)
5. **5-methyl THF** gives its methyl group to **homocysteine** (with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]] as a cofactor), creating **[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]]**
6. **THF** (now “empty” again) is regenerated and the cycle restarts
## Functions
### Folate Cycle 

- Supports **DNA synthesis and repair** (via <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dTMP and purine production</span>, see [[USMLE/Biochemistry/De novo pyrimidine and purine synthesis\|De novo pyrimidine and purine synthesis]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Enables **methyl group transfer** to regenerate methionine</span> (links to methionine cycle)
- Facilitates **serine/glycine interconversion** (amino acid metabolism)
- Essential for **cell growth, division, and genomic stability**
### Methionine Cycle 

- Produces **S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)**, the primary methyl group donor for methylation reactions (DNA, proteins, neurotransmitters, etc.)
- Regenerates **methionine from homocysteine**, preventing homocysteine toxicity
- **Connects to the folate cycle** (requires folate-derived methyl groups for homocysteine remethylation)
- Feeds the **transsulfuration pathway** for cysteine and glutathione synthesis
- Supports **synthesis of polyamines, creatine, and phosphatidylcholine** via methyltransfer reactions

# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Autosomal recessive
- Cause deficiencies in one or more of the following enzymes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|Methionine]] synthase</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cystathionine synthase</span>: an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine and serine to cystathionine, using [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B6\|vitamin B6]] as a cofactor.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)</span>: an enzyme involved in folate metabolism that reduces N5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate.
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate

# Pathophysiology
- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|Methionine]] synthase (homocysteine methyltransferase) deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]]
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency → impaired conversion of homocysteine into cystathionine
- All forms result in the accumulation of homocysteine.

# Clinical features
- Nonspecific features in infancy: growth faltering, developmental delay
- Eyes

- Psychiatric and behavioral disorders
- Light skin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Marfanoid features\|Marfanoid features]]</span>
	- Tall, thin
	- Pectus deformities (e.g., pectus excavatum)
	- Scoliosis

# Diagnostics
- ↑ Homocysteine in urine and serum
- Urine [[USMLE/Blood/Cyanide poisoning\|sodium nitroprusside]] test: Urine changes color to an intense red in the presence of homocysteine.
- Serum [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]] levels
	- Increased in cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Decreased in [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]] synthase deficiency and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency

# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients respond to large doses of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B6\|pyridoxine]] ([[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B6\|vitamin B6]]).</span>
- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|Methionine]] synthase deficiency: high-[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]] diet
- Cystathionine synthase deficiency
	- Low-[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Methionine\|methionine]], high-cysteine diet
	- Supplementation of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]] and folate
- Impaired affinity of cystathionine synthase for pyridoxal phosphate: high-cysteine diet
- MTHFR deficiency: supplementation of folate
