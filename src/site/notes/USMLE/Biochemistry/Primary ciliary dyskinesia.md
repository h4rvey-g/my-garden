# Definition
---
Rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">absent or dysmotile cilia caused by a defect in the dynein arm of microtubules.</span>

# Pathophysiology

![Pasted image 20250409095013.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250409095013.png)
Dynein: a class of motor proteins that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">convert cellular energy to mechanical energy</span>. They allow for migration, propagation, and movement of cells/organelles usually along the microtubules.
# Clinical features
---
- Chronic productive cough
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent otitis, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]], and nasal polyps</span>
- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Bronchiectasis\|Bronchiectasis]]
- Conductive [[USMLE/Neurology/Hearing loss\|hearing loss]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Displaced heart sounds (as a result of dextrocardia)</span>
- Infertility in men due to decreased sperm motility as a result of defective flagella
- Reduced fertility in women (and rarely ectopic pregnancy) due to defective cilia in fallopian tubes
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Kartagener syndrome: classic triad of situs inversus, recurrent [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]], and [[USMLE/Respiratory/Bronchiectasis\|bronchiectasis]]</span>

>[!Mnemonic] 
>You can memorize the cause of Kartagener syndrome by thinking of Kartagener's restaurant that only has 'take-out' service because there is no dine-in (dynein).

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nasal nitric oxide test: reduced nasal nitric oxide (screening test)</span>
	- Ciliary beating is thought to play a role in stimulating nitric oxide synthase (NOS), the enzyme responsible for NO production
- Genetic tests for dynein arm mutations
- Chest x-ray: bronchiectasis, dextrocardia, and situs inversus (suggests Kartagener syndrome)
