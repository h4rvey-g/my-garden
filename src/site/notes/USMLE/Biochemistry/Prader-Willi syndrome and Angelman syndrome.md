# Overview
---
- Definition: genetic syndromes caused by microdeletion (at 15q11-q13) in combination with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">genomic imprinting or uniparental disomy</span>.
	- Genomic inprinting: an epigenetic phenomenon that results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">silencing of one of the alleles of a gene depending on whether the allele was paternally or maternally inherited.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uniparental disomy</span>: a chromosomal abnormality in which offspring <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">receive two copies of one chromosome from one parent and no copies from the other parent</span>
- Etiology: The resulting condition depends on the affected gene copy. 
	- Angelman syndrome
		- Deletion or mutation of maternal UBE3A (chromosome 15) gene copy and paternal gene methylation (silencing)
		- In ∼ 5% of cases, it results from paternal <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">uniparental disomy</span> (i.e. both copies of chromosome 15 are inherited from the father).
	- Prader-Willi syndrome
		- Deletion or mutation of paternal gene copy and maternal gene methylation (silencing)
		- Caused by maternal uniparental disomy in about 20–35% of cases
- Diagnosis: genetic tests
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</span>
# Prader-Willi syndrome
---
- Clinical features 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Muscular hypotonia and poor feeding in infants</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased appetite (hyperphagia) and [[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|obesity]]</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Reproductive/Cryptorchidism\|Cryptorchidism]], [[USMLE/Reproductive/Hypogonadism\|hypogonadism]], genital [[USMLE/Pathology/Cellular adaptations\|hypoplasia]]</span>
	- Facial dysmorphia (e.g., almond-shaped eyes, thin upper lip)
	- Developmental delays (e.g., delayed achievement of milestones), intellectual disability
	- Behavioral problems (e.g., temper tantrums, stubbornness, obsessive-compulsive behavior)
- Treatment
	- Calorie restriction
	- Substitution of growth hormone and sex hormones
- Complications
	- Sleep apnea (most common)
	- Type 2 [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]]
	- Choking episodes 
	- Gastric distention and rupture
# Angelman syndrome
---
- Clinical features 
	- Delayed mental development and acquisition of motor skills in infants and young children; absent speech development
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intellectual disability</span>
	- In more than 80% of cases, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pronounced epileptic seizures</span>
	- Ataxia, tremulous movements of the limbs
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Characteristic happy demeanor with frequent laughing (inappropriate laughter)</span>
