- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most commonly due to a defect of the liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH)</span> → impaired conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine → tyrosine becomes nutritionally essential (classical PKU)
- Less commonly
	- Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (malignant PKU): due to tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (a cofactor of phenylalanine metabolism), caused by a deficiency in dihydropteridine reductase (normally reduces dihydrobiopterin to BH4), resulting in:
		- Hyperphenylalaninemia due to ↓ conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine → ↓ synthesis of catecholamines (BH4 is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Synthesis of [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|serotonin]] (BH4 is a cofactor for tryptophan hydroxylase) → deficiencies of [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|neurotransmitters]]</span>
		- Symptom severity varies between affected individuals.

	- Due to a lack of melanin

# Diagnostics
- Newborn screening: direct measurement of serum phenylalanine levels on 2<sup>nd</sup>–3<sup>rd</sup> day after birth (phenylalanine levels are normal at birth because of circulating maternal PAH)
- ↑ Phenylketones in urine
- Hyperphenylalaninemia

---
# Treatment
- Low phenylalanine and high tyrosine diet 
- BH4 deficiency: supplementation of BH4 and possibly levodopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan
