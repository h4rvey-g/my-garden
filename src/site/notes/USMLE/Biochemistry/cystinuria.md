- Definition: an inherited genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of cystine in the kidneys and bladder due to a disruption of amino acid transporter function in the proximal convoluted tubule and intestine.
- Pathophysiology: 
	- Normally, **proteins and large molecules like amino acids cannot pass the glomerular filtration barrier** because the glomerular capillaries are highly selective. However, **small molecules like dibasic amino acids can pass through the glomerular barrier** because they are small enough (molecular weight < 10 kDa) and are not repelled by the negative charge of the basement membrane. They are almost entirely reabsorbed in the PCT.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Impaired renal reabsorption of dibasic amino acids (cystine, ornithine, arginine, lysine) → accumulation of cystine in the urine → frequent formation of hexagonal cystine stones</span>

- Clinical features: recurrent [[USMLE/Renal/Nephrolithiasis#Cystine stones\|nephrolithiasis#Cystine stones]], starting as early as childhood
- Diagnostics
	- Urine microscopy: hexagonal cystine stones
	- Urinary cyanide nitroprusside test: positive
- Treatment: increase cystine solubility to counter the formation of renal stones
	- Adequate hydration
	- Urinary alkalinization: acetazolamide, potassium citrate
	- Chelating agents: penicillamine
