## Mechanisms of metastasis
![highresdefault_L88945.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L88945.jpg)
- Complex genetic changes are responsible for the selection of tumor subclones that are capable of metastasis.
- All metastases can be understood as arising from a two-part process: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">invasion of local extracellular tissue and dissemination and colonization.</span>
	- Invasion of extracellular tissue: loss of adhesion to the basement membrane → invasion through basement membrane → passage through extracellular tissue
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loss of E-cadherin expression</span> is associated with tumor metastatic potential.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Overproduction of proteases such as collagenase and matrix metalloproteinases degrade the basement membrane and interstitial matrix</span>. Neoplastic cells encounter various chemotactic and angiogenic factors in the newly exposed [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|extracellular matrix]].
		- Autocrine signaling via tumor-produced cytokines and paracrine signaling by cleaved matrix components and extracellular growth factors stimulate tumor cell locomotion towards vasculature or lymphatics.
	- Dissemination and colonization: encountering vascular or lymphatic routes → evasion of host defenses → implantation with distant tissue
		- Host defenses destroy the majority of circulating cancer cells. Mechanisms to avoid this include tumor cell aggregation, formation of platelet-tumor complexes, and binding of active coagulation factors to form malignant emboli.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disruption of cellular adhesion molecules (laminins, cadherins) enables extravasation at distant tissues.</span>
