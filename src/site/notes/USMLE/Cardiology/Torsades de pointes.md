# Etiology
- Congenital [[USMLE/Cardiology/Long QT syndromes\|Long QT syndromes]]
- Acquired [[USMLE/Cardiology/Long QT syndromes\|LQTS]] (e.g., drug-induced [[USMLE/Cardiology/Long QT syndromes\|LQTS]], electrolyte abnormalities, heart disease)

---
# Pathophysiology

---
# Clinical features
- Often asymptomatic
- Cardiovascular features
	- Palpitations
	- Tachycardia (HR ï¿½?00/min; typically regular)
	- Chest pain/pressure 
	- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|Dyspnea]], orthopnea
	- Symptoms of reduced cardiac output
		- Dizziness
		- Hypotension
		- Syncope 
		- Cardiogenic shock and loss of consciousness
- Cardiac arrest

---
# Diagnostics
- Polymorphic VT with QRS complexes that typically appear to twist around the isoelectric line, usually in self-limiting bursts
- Often preceded by bigeminy and followed by several [[USMLE/Cardiology/Premature ventricular contractions\|premature ventricular contractions]]
- R-on-T phenomenon may also be seen.

---
# Treatment
- Hemodynamically unstable patients: Defibrillation plus CPR. 
- Hemodynamically stable patients: Administer IV magnesium sulfate. 
- Identify and treat the underlying etiology of QT prolongation.
