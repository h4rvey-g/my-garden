# Etiology
- Previous infection with group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS), also referred to as [[USMLE/Infective disease/Streptococcus pyogenes\|Streptococcus pyogenes]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually acute tonsillitis or [[USMLE/Infective disease/Acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis\|pharyngitis]] (“strep throat”)</span>
	- GAS infections of the skin (e.g., erysipelas, impetigo, cellulitis) tend to be complicated by [[USMLE/Renal/Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\|poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis]] rather than rheumatic fever.

---
# Pathophysiology
- Most commonly accepted mechanism involves the following: acute tonsillitis/pharyngitis caused by GAS without antibiotic treatment → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">development of antibodies against streptococcal M protein → cross-reaction of antibodies with nerve and myocardial proteins (most commonly myosins)</span> due to molecular mimicry → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">type II hypersensitivity reaction</span> → acute inflammatory sequela

# Clinical features

>Need about 1 month to produce autoantibodies![Pasted image 20241114160307.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241114160307.png)
- Heart
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancarditis (endocarditis, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Myocarditis\|myocarditis]], and [[USMLE/Cardiology/Pericarditis\|pericarditis]])</span>
	- Valvular lesions: most commonly on high-pressure valves
		- Mitral valve (∼ 65% of cases)
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral regurgitation\|mitral regurgitation]] or prolapse</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Late [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral valve stenosis\|mitral stenosis]]: Rheumatic fever is the most frequent cause of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral valve stenosis\|mitral stenosis]].</span>
			- Mixed [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral valve stenosis\|mitral stenosis]]/regurgitation
	- Aortic valve (∼ 25% of cases)
- CNS: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sydenham chorea (involuntary, irregular, nonrepetitive movements of the limbs, neck, head, and/or face)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs 1–8 months after the inciting infection</span>
		- In contrast to the other rheumatic manifestations, which usually occur within 3 weeks after initial infection.
	- Pathophysiology: Streptococcal antigens lead to antibody production → antibodies<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> cross-react with structures of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Basal ganglia\|basal ganglia]] (particularly the striatum) and cortical structures → reversible dysfunction of cortical and striatal circuits</span>
	- Clinical features
		- Sometimes asymmetrical or confined to one side (hemichorea)
		- Additional <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">motor symptoms (e.g., ballismus, muscle weakness) and speech disorders (slurred or “jerky” speech)</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Milkmaid grip: characterized by the inability to maintain muscle contraction in the hands → intermittent loss of contraction results in alternating squeeze and release of grip ("milking")</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Choreic hand: characterized by intermittent wrist flexion with extension of the digits (“spooning” of the hand)</span>
		- Neuropsychiatric symptoms (e.g., inappropriate laughing/crying, agitation, anxiety, apathy, obsessive-compulsive behavior)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Don't mess with [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypopituitarism\|Sheehan syndrome]]</span>
- Skin
	- Subcutaneous nodules 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythema marginatum</span>: centrifugally expanding pink or light red rash with a well-defined outer border and central clearing. ![L10619.png](/img/user/appendix/L10619.png)
		- Painless and nonpruritic

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- Major criteria: SPACE
>	- Subcutaneous nodules
>	- Pancarditis
>	- Arthritis (Polyarthritis; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthritis also qualifies)
>	- Chorea
>	- Erythema marginatum
>
>- Minor criteria: LEAF
>	- Long PR interval
>	- ESR ≥ 60mm/hr (or ≥ 30mm/hr in moderate to high-risk population) and CRP ≥ 3mg/dl
>	- Arthralgia (Polyarthralgia; for moderate to high-risk population – monoarthralgia also qualifies)
>	- Fever ( ≥ 38.5c; ≥ 38c for moderate to high-risk population )

## ECG
- Most common: prolonged PR interval (first-degree AV block)  
- Potential additional findings include:
	- Second-degree AV block 
	- Complete heart block 
	- Sinus tachycardia
	- Accelerated junctional rhythm
	- ECG features of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Pericarditis\|pericarditis]]

>Whenever you see marked <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">left atrial abnormality or [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atrial fibrillation\|atrial fibrillation]] in the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy signs</span>, always think about rheumatic mitral valve disease. [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral valve stenosis\|Mitral stenosis]] is the only single lesion that can readily account for the combination of left atrial enlargement and right ventricular hypertrophy.
## Pathology
