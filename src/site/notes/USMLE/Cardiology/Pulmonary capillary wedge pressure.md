| Location               | Pressure (mm Hg)                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Right atrium           | Mean: 1-6                          |
| Right ventricle        | Systolic: 15-30<br>Diastolic: 1-6  |
| Pulmonary artery       | Systolic: 15-30<br>Diastolic: 6-12 |
| Left atrial/PCWP/LVEDP | Mean: 6-12                         |

The left atrium and pulmonary veins are thin-walled and highly compliant chambers. Because of this, any pressure changes in the left atrium are readily transmitted to the pulmonary veins, including the wedged position of the catheter. So, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">PCWP essentially mirrors LAP.</span>
The normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is between 4 to 12 mmHg.
