A defect of atrioventricular valves (i.e., mitral and tricuspid valves) as well as the atrial and/or ventricular septum; previously referred to as endocardial cushion defects.
# Etiology

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Strongly associated with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Down syndrome\|Down syndrome]] </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Association with [[USMLE/Reproductive/Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy\|maternal diabetes]] and [[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|obesity]] has been shown in some studies. </span>
# Pathophysiology 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Complete form ([[USMLE/Psychiatry/Autism spectrum disorder\|ASD]] and [[USMLE/Cardiology/Ventricular septal defect\|VSD]] + single AV valves) → atrial and ventricular left-to-right shunt → excessive pulmonary blood flow and biventricular volume overload → [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|pulmonary hypertension]] and [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]]</span>![L14174.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L14174.jpg)
- Partial form ([[USMLE/Cardiology/Atrial septal defect\|ASD]] only) → atrial left-to-right shunt → symptoms that may remain minimal until adulthood
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In both forms: abnormal AV valve → AV valve regurgitation → in utero heart failure (nonimmune hydrops fetalis) </span>
