- Coronary arterial dominance 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Right-dominant (�?85% of the population): posterior descending artery (PDA) supplied by the RCA</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Left-dominant (�?8% of the population): PDA supplied by the left circumflex artery (LCX)</span>
	- Codominant (balanced; �?7% of people): PDA supplied by both RCA and LCX
- Coronary blood flow peaks during early diastole at a point when the pressure differential between the aorta and the ventricle is the greatest (see left ventricular pressure-volume diagram.)
- Right coronary artery (RCA)
	- Right marginal artery: courses along the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diaphragmatic border (acute margin) of the heart</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lateral right ventricle and cardiac apex</span>
	- Posterior descending artery (PDA): descends between right and left ventricles on posterior surface of heart (in the posterior interventricular sulcus) towards cardiac apex
		- Can also originate from the LCX OR LCX and RCA (in left-dominant and codominant circulation, respectively)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atrioventricular nodal artery</span>
		- AV node (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in a left dominant circulation, the AV node is supplied by the LCA</span>)
		- Bundle of His (minor contribution from the LAD)
