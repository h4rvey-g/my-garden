# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Potassium excess: due to altered K<sup>+</sup> metabolism or intake
	- Reduced excretion: acute and [[USMLE/Renal/Chronic kidney disease\|chronic kidney disease]] 
	- Endocrine causes: hypocortisolism, hypoaldosteronism 
	- Drugs: potassium-sparing [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]], ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]], and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</span> 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Especially in [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]] patients who are taking high-dose TMP-SMX</span>
		- Similar to the actions of amiloride, trimethoprim blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule and collecting duct.  This reduces transepithelial voltage and impairs sodium-potassium exchange, leading to reduced potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.
	- Type IV [[USMLE/Renal/Renal tubular disorders\|renal tubular acidosis]]
	- Increased intake
		- High potassium diet, e.g., fresh fruits, dried fruits and legumes, vegetables, nuts, seeds, bran products, milk, and dairy products
		- K<sup>+</sup> containing IV fluids
- Extracellular shift
- Extracellular release

## Enhanced potassium elimination
### Cation-exchange medications
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanism of action: These drugs release Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions in the gut, which are exchanged for K<sup>+</sup>, thereby enhancing enteral K<sup>+</sup> elimination.</span>
- Clinical applications: nonurgent lowering of K<sup>+</sup> 
- Options
	- Cation-exchange resins 
		- Sodium polystyrene sulfonate: falling out of favor due to adverse effects
		- Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cation-exchange polymers, e.g., patiromer </span>
- Adverse effects
	- Gastrointestinal upset
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypokalemia\|Hypokalemia]]
