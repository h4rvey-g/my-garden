## Coronary artery disease
- Coronary artery disease (CAD): ischemic heart disease due to narrowing or blockage of coronary arteries, most commonly due to atherosclerosis, resulting in a mismatch between myocardial oxygen supply and demand
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stable CAD: a form of CAD in which patients are either asymptomatic or have stable or low-risk unstable angina; also used for patients with a history of MI whose symptoms are controlled with treatment</span>
## Chest pain and angina
### Preferred terminology for types of chest pain 
- Cardiac chest pain: likely associated with cardiac ischemia based on symptoms (e.g., central, retrosternal, squeezing, exertional).
- Possible cardiac chest pain: may be associated with cardiac ischemia based on symptoms (e.g., stabbing, tearing, ripping, burning).
- Noncardiac chest pain: unlikely associated with cardiac ischemia based on symptoms (e.g., positional, fleeting).
### Historical terminology for types of chest pain 
The following terms are no longer recommended for use in the 2021 AHA/ACC chest pain guidelines. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typical angina fulfills all of the following criteria:</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Retrosternal chest pain of characteristic nature and duration (e.g., transient retrosternal pressure)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Provoked by exertion or emotional stress</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relieved by rest and/or nitroglycerin</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Atypical angina: fulfills only two of the aforementioned criteria</span>
- Nonanginal chest pain: fulfills one or none of the aforementioned criteria

# Clinical features
---
## Stable angina
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms are reproducible/predictable and severity, frequency, and threshold for reproduction of symptoms do not change.</span>
- Symptoms often subside within minutes with rest or after administration of nitroglycerin 
- Common triggers include physical/mental stress or exposure to cold

# Treatment
## Approach
- All patients: pharmacotherapy for CAD
	- Start prevention of recurrent CAD, i.e., antiplatelet agents, statins, and management of comorbidities.
	- Start antianginal medication.
## Pharmacotherapy for CAD
### Antianginal drugs
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Goal: reduction of myocardial oxygen demand (MVO2)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line agent: [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|beta blockers]]</span>
- Second-line agents: [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Calcium channel blockers\|CCBs]], [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Nitrates\|nitrates]], ranolazine
- Third-line agent: Consider ranolazine if beta-blockers, [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Calcium channel blockers\|CCBs]], and [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Nitrates\|nitrates]] are ineffective or not tolerated.

### Prevention of recurrence and/or progression
- Antiplatelet agents
- ACEIs or ARBs
- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|Beta blockers]]

# Subtypes and variants
---
## Vasospastic angina
Previously known as variant or Prinzmetal angina
### Description
- Angina caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient coronary spasms</span> (usually due to spasms occurring close to areas of coronary stenosis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Not affected by exertion (may also occur at rest)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically occurs early in the morning</span>
### Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cigarette smoking</span>; use of stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines), alcohol, or triptans
- Stress, hyperventilation, exposure to cold
- Common atherosclerotic risk factors (except smoking) do not apply to vasospastic angina.
### Pathogenesis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperreactivity of coronary smooth muscle due to endothelial dysfunction & autonomic imbalance</span>
	- Triggered by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">excess vagal tone</span>, and they occur <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most commonly at night when vagal tone is at a peak.</span>
	- Both <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|acetylcholine]] and ergot alkaloids (eg, dihydroergotamine) provoke symptoms</span> and may also aid in diagnosis, as follows:
		- Acetylcholine normally stimulates endothelial muscarinic receptors to cause vasodilation via increased release of nitric oxide.  However, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a deficiency of endothelial nitric oxide in affected patients causes increased vagal tone to instead trigger vasoconstriction</span> and precipitate vasospastic symptoms.
		- Ergot alkaloids activate 5-HT2 serotonergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction.  Normally, the vasoconstriction is somewhat offset by endothelial release of vasodilatory prostaglandins, but this response is lacking in affected patients due to endothelial dysfunction.
### Clinical presentation
- Young age (<50)
- Minimal CAD risk factors (other than smoking)
- Recurrent chest discomfort
	- At rest or during sleep
	- Spontaneous resolution ≤15 min
### Diagnosis
- ECG: ST-segment elevation during episode
- Coronary angiography: no CAD
### Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smoking cessation</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Avoid beta-blockers</span> (particularly nonselective beta blockers), and other agents that induce vasoconstriction
	- Blockade of beta-2 receptors prevents smooth muscle cell relaxation and may cause additional vasoconstriction.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">First-line therapy: calcium channel blockers</span>, e.g., verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine
