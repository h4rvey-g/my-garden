# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Atherosclerosis
- Takayasu arteritis
- Thoracic surgery

# Pathophysiology
---
- Stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Left subclavian artery �?70% of cases</span>) �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypoperfusion distal to the stenosis �?reversal of blood flow in ipsilateral vertebral artery</span> �?compensation through collateral arteries �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduced blood flow in the basilar artery �?reduced cerebral perfusion upon exertion involving the affected arm</span>
	- During arm exertion, increased metabolic demand causes vasodilation and blood diversion from the vertebral artery to supply the arm

# Clinical features
---
- Most patients are asymptomatic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Limb ischemia (on exertion)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pain, paresthesia</span>
	- Pale, cool skin
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weak, delayed radial pulse</span>
	- Disparity in BP > 15 mm Hg
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurologic symptoms (due to vertebrobasilar insufficiency)</span>
	- Dizziness, vertigo
	- Ocular findings (e.g., diplopia)
	- Syncope

# Diagnostics
---
Imaging of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cerebral and upper extremity arteries</span>, e.g., via <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Doppler ultrasound</span>, duplex ultrasound, or magnetic resonance angiography, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">shows reversal of blood flow and/or atherosclerosis.</span>
