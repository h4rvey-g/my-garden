# Abnormal JVP Waveforms
*   **Large 'a' wave:** Increased resistance to right atrial emptying.
    *   **Causes:** Tricuspid stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension.
*   **Cannon 'a' waves:** Very large, intermittent 'a' waves.
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve (AV dissociation).
    *   **Causes:** Complete heart block (third-degree), ventricular tachycardia, premature ventricular/junctional contractions.
*   **Absent 'a' wave:** No coordinated atrial contraction.
    *   **Cause:** Atrial fibrillation.
*   **Large 'v' wave (or c-v fusion wave):**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Blood regurgitates into the right atrium during ventricular systole.
    *   **Cause:** **Tricuspid regurgitation**.
*   **Rapid/Steep 'y' descent (Friedreich's sign):**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Rapid, early diastolic filling of a stiff or non-compliant ventricle.
    *   **Causes:** **Constrictive pericarditis**, restrictive cardiomyopathy.
*   **Slow 'y' descent:**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Obstruction of right ventricular filling.
    *   **Causes:** Tricuspid stenosis, right atrial myxoma.
*   **Blunted/Absent 'y' descent:**
    *   **Pathophysiology:** Impaired right ventricular filling due to external pressure.
    *   **Cause:** **Cardiac tamponade**.

# Pathology
Common abnormalities of the JVP waveform include:  
- Constrictive pericarditis: elevated JVP (due to increased external atrial pressure) with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prominent x (exaggerated atrial relaxation) and y (early rapid ventricular filling) descent</span>  
- Cardiac tamponade: elevated JVP (due to increased external atrial pressure), a prominent x descent (exaggerated atrial relaxation), and a blunt or absent y descent (minimal ventricular filling)  
- Tricuspid regurgitation: prominent v wave as the blood from the right ventricle regurgitates into the right atrium during ventricular systole (atrial diastole), increasing interatrial pressure and volume  
- Tricuspid stenosis: giant a wave due to high right atrial systolic pressure  
- Atrial septal defect: v wave â‰¥ a wave due to the left-to-right shunting of blood  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block: cannon a waves due to the loss of AV synchronization and contraction of the atria against a closed tricuspid valve</span>
- Atrial fibrillation: absent a waves due to ineffective contraction of the atria
