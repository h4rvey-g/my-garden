- Epidemiology
	- Most common in individuals 50�?0 years of age
- Etiology
	- Genetic susceptibility
		- Presence of a genetic mutation that causes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased acetyltransferase activity, which results in the slow acetylation of drugs</span>
	- Drug triggers 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High risk: procainamide and hydralazine </span>
		- Low risk: sulfa drugs and certain nonsulfa drugs, (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">isoniazid</span>, methyldopa, minocycline, phenytoin, TNF-α inhibitors)
- Clinical features (usually manifest �?1 month after medication initiation)
	- Constitutional: fatigue, fever, and weight loss
	- Musculoskeletal: myalgia and symmetrical polyarthralgia
	- Skin lesions (e.g., malar rash)
- Diagnostics
	- ANAs are positive in nearly all patients.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antihistone antibodies</span>
		- Antihistone antibodies are seen in 90�?5% of patients.![Pasted image 20240116151535.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240116151535.png)

>DILE can manifest with various features that are also seen in idiopathic [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|SLE]] (e.g., fever, arthritis, malar rash, serositis) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but typically does not affect the CNS or kidneys, unlike [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|SLE]].</span>
