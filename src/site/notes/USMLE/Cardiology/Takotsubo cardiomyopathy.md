# Epidemiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">90% of affected individuals are postmenopausal women.</span>
- More common in patients with preexisting mental illness

# Etiology
---

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Emotional/physical stress → activation of the sympathetic nervous system → massive catecholamine discharge → cardiotoxicity, multivessel spasms, and dysfunction → myocardial stunning</span>
	- A state of abnormal regional LV wall motion that persists for hours to weeks following transient ischemia

# Clinical features
---
- Patients typically have <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chest pain that can mimic a myocardial infarction</span> and may also have symptoms of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]] (eg, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|dyspnea]], lower extremity swelling). 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ECG often shows evidence of ischemia</span> (eg, ST elevation, T-wave inversion) in the anterior precordial leads; however, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">coronary angiography typically reveals an absence of obstructive [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|coronary artery disease]].  </span>
- The condition usually <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">resolves within several weeks</span> with supportive treatment only.

# Diagnostics
---
## Echocardiography (TTE)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Global LV dyskinesis involving the apex (most common)</span>
- Regional wall motion abnormalities
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Apical left ventricular ballooning (not always present)</span>![Pasted image 20241115214325.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241115214325.png)
