- Cardiac blood pressures (measured via Swan-Ganz catheterization)
	- Right atrium: < 5 mm Hg
	- Right ventricle (pulmonary artery pressure): 25/5 mm Hg
		- During systole, pressures in the right ventricle are much lower than in the left ventricle (only ~25 mm Hg compared to ~120 mm Hg).  As a result, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">coronary perfusion pressure is able to overcome right ventricular wall pressure throughout the cardiac cycle, leading to relatively constant blood flow to the right ventricular myocardium.</span>
	- Left atrium (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure): < 12 mm Hg (higher than left ventricular pressure in mitral stenosis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Left ventricle: 130/10 mm Hg</span>
	- Coronary perfusion pressure
		- The driving pressure that forces blood into the coronary arteries during diastole
		- Calculated as the difference in pressure between the aorta and left ventricle during diastole
