## S3
- Features
	- Heard just after S2 <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(after opening of mitral valve)</span>
	- Caused by reverberant sound as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">blood fills an enlarged LV cavity</span> during passive diastolic filling (i.e. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">end systolic volume is high</span>)
- Associated disorders
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|Heart failure]] with reduced EF</span>
	- High-output states (eg, thyrotoxicosis)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mitral or aortic regurgitation</span>
	- Teens or athletes
		- Hearts are trained to handle more blood
## S4
- Features
	- Heard just before S1 <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(before closing of mitral valve)</span>
	- Caused by blood striking a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stiff LV wall</span> during atrial contraction
		- As the atria contracts in late diastole against a stiffened ventricle, it must increase its force-production, which creates turbulent blood flow.
- Associated disorders
	- Concentric LV hypertrophy
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Restrictive cardiomyopathy\|Restrictive cardiomyopathy]]
	- Acute myocardial infarction
## S2 split
- Physiological split
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The sound of aortic valve closure (A2) precedes the sound of pulmonary valve closure (P2) during inspiration</span>
	- Especially pronounced among young individuals
- Wide split
	- Caused by any condition that increases right ventricular afterload or decreases left ventricular preload
	- Causes
		- Pulmonary hypertension
		- Pulmonary valve stenosis
		- RBBB
- Fixed split
	- ASD
- Paradoxical split (reversed split)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Audible during expiration but not inspiration</span>
		- Expiration: A2 is heard after P2 during expiration due to delayed closure of the aortic valve (split reversal)
		- Inspiration: the closure of the pulmonary valve is also delayed, resulting in A2 and P2 occurring simultaneously (i.e., a paradoxical decrease in the split during inspiration)
	- Causes
		- Aortic stenosis
		- Left bundle branch block

# Pathology
Common abnormalities of the JVP waveform include:  
- Constrictive pericarditis: elevated JVP (due to increased external atrial pressure) with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prominent x (exaggerated atrial relaxation) and y (early rapid ventricular filling) descent</span>  
- Cardiac tamponade: elevated JVP (due to increased external atrial pressure), a prominent x descent (exaggerated atrial relaxation), and a blunt or absent y descent (minimal ventricular filling)  
- Tricuspid regurgitation: prominent v wave as the blood from the right ventricle regurgitates into the right atrium during ventricular systole (atrial diastole), increasing interatrial pressure and volume  
- Tricuspid stenosis: giant a wave due to high right atrial systolic pressure  
- Atrial septal defect: v wave ≥ a wave due to the left-to-right shunting of blood  
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block: cannon a waves due to the loss of AV synchronization and contraction of the atria against a closed tricuspid valve</span>
- Atrial fibrillation: absent a waves due to ineffective contraction of the atria
