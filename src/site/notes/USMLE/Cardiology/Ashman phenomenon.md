Ashman phenomenon occurs when a short RR interval is preceded by a long RR interval. When the new atrial impulse reaches the still refractory bundle of His, it is typically <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transmitted only through the left bundle</span> (which has a shorter refractory period than the right). The resultant appearance is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">morphologically similar to RBBB</span>. Ashman phenomenon may be mistaken for a premature ventricular complex or ventricular tachycardia.
