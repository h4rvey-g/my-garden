# Etiology
---
- Decreased intake
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use\|Starvation]], anorexia
- Intracellular translocation
	- Insulin (eg, treatment of [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperglycemic crises\|DKA]], refeeding syndrome)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">β-adrenergic activity</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pharmacologic (eg, albuterol, dobutamine)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stress-induced (eg, [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Alcohol withdrawal\|alcohol withdrawal]], acute MI)</span>
			- Catecholamine (eg, norepinephrine, epinephrine) release. Epinephrine activates the beta-2 receptor, leading to increased activity of the sodium-potassium ATPase pump and the sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter, both of which transport potassium intracellularly.
	- Alkalosis (respiratory or metabolic)
	- ↑ Cell reproduction (eg, [[USMLE/Blood/Acute leukemia\|acute myeloid leukemia]], GM-CSF)
- Gastrointestinal loss
	- Diarrhea, vomiting, [[USMLE/Endocrine/Primary hyperaldosteronism\|hyperaldosteronism]]
- Urinary loss
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Primary hyperaldosteronism\|Hyperaldosteronism]], diuretics, [[USMLE/Renal/Renal tubular disorders\|RTA]] types 1 and 2
- Sweat loss
	- Extreme exercise in hot climate

# Pathophysiology
---
- ↑ Extracellular K+ concentration → resting membrane potential becomes less negative than -90 mV → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ excitability</span>
