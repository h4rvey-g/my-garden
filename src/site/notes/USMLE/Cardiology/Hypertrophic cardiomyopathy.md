# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- HCM is a genetic condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">otherwise unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. </span>
- Most common hereditary heart disease
	- Autosomal dominant inheritance with varying penetrance
	- Most commonly caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutations</span> of the sarcomeric protein genes (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">myosin heavy chain</span>, myosin binding protein C) �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">disorganization of myocyte</span> architecture characterized by myofibrillar disarray and fibrosis![L65531.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L65531.jpg)![L65544.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L65544.jpg)
- Other conditions that are associated with left-ventricular hypertrophy include the following:
	- Chronic hypertension (most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy)
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Aortic valve stenosis\|Aortic stenosis]]
	- [[USMLE/Neurology/Friedreich ataxia\|Friedreich ataxia]], [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Lysosomal Storage Diseases\|Fabry disease]], Noonan syndrome
	- [[USMLE/Pathology/Amyloidosis\|Amyloidosis]]

# Pathophysiology
>[!tip] 
>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">localized, asymmetrical</span>, rather than uniform, thickening of the LV walls, predominantly affecting the interventricular <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">septum</span>.
>This is different from hypertensive heart disease, which shows uniformly thickened left ventricular (LV) walls
## HOCM
- Mechanisms of obstruction
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, results in mitral-septal contact during mid-to-late systole</span> ; caused by either or both:![Pasted image 20240120195607.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240120195607.png)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Venturi effect: accelerated blood flow through ventricular outflow tract creates negative pressure that pulls the mitral valve towards the septum �?increased outflow tract obstruction</span>
		- Ejection against an elongated and distorted mitral valve causes leaflets to get pulled into the outflow tract �?potential secondary mitral regurgitation 
	- Muscular obstruction
		- Encroachment of the LVOT by the hypertrophic septum
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LVOT obstruction is dynamic </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The following factors can increase the degree of obstruction: �?LV contractility, �?preload, and �?afterload </span>
	- Clinically exacerbating factors 
		- These factors lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased heart contraction force</span> and cardiac output and, thus, enhance the ejection flow. This <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increases the Venturi effect</span> force described above.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Physical exercise/stress</span>
		- Dehydration
		- Pharmacologic provocation (e.g., [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]], ACEIs/ARBs, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Cardiac glycosides\|digoxin]], hydralazine)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Vagal maneuver\|Valsalva maneuver]] (strain phase)</span>
			- Leads to decreased preload
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compare with [[USMLE/Cardiology/Aortic valve stenosis\|Aortic stenosis]], which alleviates upon [[USMLE/Cardiology/Vagal maneuver\|Valsalva maneuver]]</span>

# Clinical features
- Symptoms: worsen with exercise, dehydration, and use of certain drugs (e.g., [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]], hydralazine, ACEIs/ARBs, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Cardiac glycosides\|digoxin]])
	- Frequently asymptomatic (especially the nonobstructive type)
	- Exertional dyspnea
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|Angina]] pectoris 
	- Dizziness, lightheadedness, syncope
	- Palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden cardiac death (particularly during or after intense physical activity)</span>
- Physical examination 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Systolic ejection murmur (crescendo-decrescendo) at left sternal border</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Note the location is different from aortic stenosis, which is at **right upper sternal border** (the aortic area). This is because obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract is below the aortic valve.</span>
		- Increases with [[USMLE/Cardiology/Vagal maneuver\|Valsalva maneuver]], standing, inotropic drugs (e.g., [[USMLE/Cardiology/Cardiac glycosides\|digitalis]]) 
		- Decreases with:
			- Hand grip, squatting, or passive leg elevation
			- Drugs that decrease cardiac contractility (e.g., [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|beta blockers]])
	- Possible holosystolic murmur from mitral regurgitation
	- Sustained apex beat
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S4 gallop</span>
	- Paradoxical split of S2 
	- Pulsus bisferiens: LV outflow obstruction causes a sudden quick rise of the pulse followed by a slower longer rise (biphasic pulse).
