- Mostly idiopathic
- Connective tissue disorders: [[USMLE/Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome\|Marfan syndrome]], [[USMLE/Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome\|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], [[USMLE/MSK/Osteogenesis imperfecta\|osteogenesis imperfecta]]

![Pasted image 20240802085832.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240802085832.png)
* **Myxomatous degeneration** of the mitral valve leaflets and chordae tendineae is the primary cause, leading to redundant, thickened, and "floppy" valve tissue. This causes the leaflets to bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium during systole.
* <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It's the most common cause of primary **[[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral regurgitation\|mitral regurgitation]] (MR)** in developed countries.</span>
* Can be an isolated finding or associated with **connective tissue diseases** like [[USMLE/Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome\|Marfan syndrome]], [[USMLE/Pathology/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome\|Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], and [[USMLE/MSK/Osteogenesis imperfecta\|osteogenesis imperfecta]].

![Pasted image 20240802090542.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240802090542.png)
- Any activity that decreases the left ventricular volume (e.g. standing) will exaggerate the tendency for prolapse. Thus the click and the murmur moves closer to S1.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Any activity that increases the left ventricular volume (e.g. squatting) will decrease tendency for prolapse. Thus the click and the murmur moves close to S2, or not happen at all.</span>
