# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|Atherosclerosis]] (∼ 90% of cases): occurs more often in men > 50 years of age; increased risk in smokers </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/MSK/Fibromuscular dysplasia\|Fibromuscular dysplasia]] (∼ 10% of cases): mostly affects women < 50 years of age</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Narrowing of one or both renal arteries</span> → obstruction of renal blood flow → ischemia → renin release and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system → hyperreninemic [[USMLE/Endocrine/Primary hyperaldosteronism\|hyperaldosteronism]] (increased renin → increased angiotensin → increased aldosterone) → increased sodium retention and peripheral vascular resistance → renovascular hypertension (secondary hypertension) 
- Prolonged renal hypoperfusion → chronic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular apparatus to secrete renin → hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus 
- No improvement in renal blood flow → ischemic renal injury → renal insufficiency and progressive renal atrophy (unilateral or bilateral depending on laterality of RAS) 

# Clinical features
---
- Family history of hypertension is often absent.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension: severe (i.e., resistant to therapy)</span> and/or early-onset (i.e, hypertension in individuals < 30 years of age) 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal bruit</span> heard over the flank or epigastrium: present during both systole and diastole 
- Flash pulmonary edema
- Features of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|atherosclerosis]] in other parts of the body (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Peripheral arterial disease\|peripheral artery disease]], [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|coronary artery disease]], carotid stenosis)

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">New-onset or worsening of renal dysfunction (↑ serum creatinine) after initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs</span>
	- ACE inhibitors and ARBs can induce or worsen renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with severe bilateral renal artery stenosis or high-grade unilateral stenosis.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unexplained renal atrophy or asymmetry of > 1.5 cm between the kidneys</span>
- Unexplained acute pulmonary edema
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DDx: [[USMLE/MSK/Fibromuscular dysplasia\|Fibromuscular dysplasia]]</span>
