# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Intrauterine risk factors: infants born to mothers with [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]]

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Failed spiraling</span> of the aorticopulmonary septum → RV emptying into the aorta and LV into the pulmonary artery → complete isolation of the pulmonary and systemic circuits → ↓ oxygenated blood entering the systemic circulation
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatal, unless mixing occurs via an intracardiac shunt (e.g., PFO, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Ventricular septal defect\|VSD]], [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atrial septal defect\|ASD]]) or via an extracardiac connection (e.g., PDA)</span>

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
---
- Chest x-ray: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">narrow mediastinum ± cardiomegaly ("egg on a string")</span>
	- The enlarged, globular heart resembles an egg lying on its side.
	- The string represents the narrow superior mediastinum due to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stress-induced thymic atrophy and hyperinflated lungs.</span>![Pasted image 20240407203434.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240407203434.png)
- Hyperoxia test: little to no ↑ in arterial oxygenation with 100% O2
- Echocardiography typically confirmatory
