- Renal: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute hypertensive nephrosclerosis (formerly malignant nephrosclerosis)</span>
	- [[USMLE/Renal/Acute kidney injury\|Acute kidney injury]] (azotemia and/or oliguria, edema) and microhematuria
	- Pathophysiology: severe hypertension → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute thrombotic microangiopathy → thrombosis of glomerular capillaries and red blood cell extravasation and fragmentation as well as luminal thrombosis of arterioles → infarction and necrosis of endothelial and mesangial cells → decreased glomerular blood flow → acute kidney damage</span>
	- Histopathologic patterns
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cell death\|Fibrinoid necrosis]]</span>: Cell death and excessive fibrin deposition within the arteriolar walls is visible as circumferential, amorphous, pink material with smudged, necrotic endothelial cells that lack cytologic detail.
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acute, compared with hyaline [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|Arteriolosclerosis]]</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperplastic [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|arteriolosclerosis]]</span>:  Over time, activated platelets and injured endothelial cells release growth factors, which induce concentric hyperplasia and layering of smooth muscle cells and [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Extracellular matrix\|collagen]], resulting in intimal thickening and an "onion-skin" appearance.

# Treatment

- The drugs most commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies are nitroprusside, labetalol, and nicardipine.
