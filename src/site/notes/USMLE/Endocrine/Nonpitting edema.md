- **Pitting Edema**: When pressure is applied to a swollen area, it leaves a persistent indentation or "pit". This is the more common type and is typically due to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">displacement of low-protein fluid.</span>
- **Non-Pitting Edema**: In this type, the skin does not indent when pressed. It is caused by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">accumulation of protein-rich fluid</span>, which leads to tissue fibrosis and a "doughy" or firm consistency.
