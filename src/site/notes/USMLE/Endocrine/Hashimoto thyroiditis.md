# Epidemiology
- Hashimoto disease is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the most common form of thyroiditis and the most frequent cause of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]] in the US.</span>
- Iodine deficiency is the most common cause of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]] worldwide.
- Sex: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">♀ > ♂ (7:1)</span>
- Age of onset: occurs in all age groups; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most prevalent in women aged 30–50 years</span>

# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Associations with [[USMLE/Immunology/HLA system\|HLA-DR3]], and DR5 have been proposed.
- Cellular (especially T cells) and humoral immune responses are activated  → active <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">B lymphocytes produce thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs) → destruction of thyroid tissue</span>

---
# Clinical features
- Early-stage
	- Primarily asymptomatic
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Goiter\|Goiter]]: nontender or painless</span>, rubbery thyroid with moderate and symmetrical enlargement
	- Hashitoxicosis may occur: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">transient thyrotoxicosis</span> due to follicular rupture of hormone-containing thyroid tissue that manifests with signs of [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]] (e.g., irritability, heat intolerance, [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]])
- Late-stage
	- Thyroid may be normal-sized or small if extensive fibrosis has occurred.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Signs of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]]</span> (e.g., cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue)

# Diagnostics
- Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Early-stage: Transient hashitoxicosis</span> may appear (↓ TSH, ↑ FT3, and ↑ FT4).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progression: subclinical [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]]</span> (mildly ↑ TSH; normal FT3 and FT4) 
	- Late-stage: overt [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]] (↑ TSH; ↓ FT4 and ↓ FT3)
- Thyroid antibodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TPOAbs</span> (formerly anti-microsomal antibodies): positive in up to 95% of patients
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anti-TgAbs</span>: positive in 60–80% of patients
- Fine-needle aspiration
	- Indications: patients with focal nodules to exclude malignancy (see “Workup of thyroid nodules”)
	- Findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">diffuse lymphocytic infiltration (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) with germinal centers, oncocytic-metaplastic cells (Hurthle cells)</span>, and fibrotic tissue![L63985.png](/img/user/appendix/L63985.png)

| Feature                 | Postpartum Thyroiditis (Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis)                                            | Hashimoto's Thyroiditis                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cause**               | Autoimmune, triggered by pregnancy                                                                   | Autoimmune, unrelated to pregnancy                    |
| **Population Affected** | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Women postpartum</span>                              | Any age, both genders, more common in women           |
| **Timeline**            | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Within 1 year after childbirth or miscarriage</span> | Chronic and progressive                               |
| **Phases**              | Hyperthyroid → Hypothyroid → Recovery                                                                | Typically hypothyroidism developing over time         |
