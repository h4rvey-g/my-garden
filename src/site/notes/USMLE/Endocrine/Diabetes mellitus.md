# Pathophysiology
---
## Normal insulin physiology
- Secretion: Insulin is synthesized in the β cells of the islets of Langerhans. The <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cleavage of proinsulin (precursor molecule of insulin)</span> produces C-peptide (connecting peptide) and insulin, which consists of two peptide chains (A and B chains).
- Action
	- Carbohydrate metabolism
	- Protein metabolism: insulin inhibits proteolysis, stimulates protein synthesis, and stimulates cellular uptake of [[USMLE/REVIEW/Amino acids\|amino acids]]
	- Lipid metabolism: maintains a fat depot and has an antiketogenic effect 
	- Electrolyte regulation: 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulates intracellular potassium accumulation </span>
			- Directly stimulates Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase and promotes intracellular alkalosis, reduces phosphate levels (glucose binds to phosphate in the cell), and stimulates magnesium uptake into cells
			- Insulin boosts glucose uptake into cells through two linked processes:
				1. Direct effect: Insulin stimulates [[USMLE/Endocrine/Glucose transporters\|GLUT]] transporters to move glucose into cells through facilitated diffusion
				2. Indirect effect: Insulin activates Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pumps, which:
				    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pump Na⁺ out of cells → Creates high Na⁺ outside</span>
				    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This Na⁺ gradient powers SGLT transporters</span>
				    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">SGLT uses Na⁺ flow into cells to drag glucose in with it (co-transport)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reduces phosphate levels: When insulin promotes glucose uptake, glucose must be phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Those with long-standing diabetes (ie, >5 years) frequently also have alpha cell failure with decreased glucagon secretion and therefore have an even greater risk of rapid [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]].</span>
## Type 2 diabetes
- Mechanisms
	- Peripheral insulin resistance
		- Numerous genetic and environmental factors
			- Central [[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|obesity]] → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased plasma levels of free fatty acids → impaired insulin-dependent glucose uptake</span> into hepatocytes, myocytes, and adipocytes 
			- Increased serine kinase activity in fat and skeletal muscle cells → phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 → decreased affinity of IRS-1 for PI3K → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased expression of GLUT4 channels → decreased cellular glucose uptake</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pancreatic β cell dysfunction: accumulation of pro-amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide) in the pancreas  → decreased endogenous insulin production</span>
- Progression
	- Initially, insulin resistance is compensated by increased insulin and amylin secretion. 
	- Over the course of the disease, insulin resistance progresses, while insulin secretion capacity declines.
	- After a period of impaired glucose tolerance with isolated postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetes manifests with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Metabolic fuel use\|fasting]] hyperglycemia.

# Treatment
---
## Approach
- **Guiding Principles (ADA/EASD):** Initial therapy is lifestyle modification + Metformin. Subsequent agent selection is based on patient comorbidities (ASCVD, HF, CKD), risk of hypoglycemia, impact on weight, and cost.
    
- **First-Line (Type 2 DM):**
    
    - **Metformin:**
        - **MOA:** ↓ Hepatic gluconeogenesis, ↑ peripheral insulin sensitivity.
        - **Benefits:** Weight neutral/modest loss, low hypoglycemia risk, proven efficacy.
        - **SE/CI:** GI distress (diarrhea), **lactic acidosis** (do not use if eGFR <30), B12 deficiency. Hold for IV contrast procedures.
- **Second-Line Selection (after Metformin):**
    
    - **If patient has ASCVD, HF, or CKD:** Choose an agent with proven cardiorenal benefit, regardless of A1c.
        
        - **ASCVD Dominant:** **GLP-1 RA** (e.g., Liraglutide, Semaglutide) > **SGLT2i** (e.g., Empagliflozin).
        - **HF or CKD:** **SGLT2i** is preferred (reduces HF hospitalizations & CKD progression). GLP-1 RA is a secondary option if SGLT2i is CI/not tolerated.
    - **If compelling need to minimize hypoglycemia:**
        
        - Use DPP-4i, GLP-1 RA, SGLT2i, or TZD. Avoid Sulfonylureas & Insulin.
    - **If compelling need for weight loss:**
        
        - Use **GLP-1 RA** (most effective) or **SGLT2i**.
    - **If cost is a major issue:**
        
        - Use **Sulfonylurea** or **TZD**. Be mindful of side effect profiles.
- **If Glucose Control Remains Suboptimal (Third-Line Therapy):**
    
    - **Action:** Add a third agent with a complementary mechanism of action.
    - **Selection:** Re-evaluate and prioritize based on patient comorbidities (ASCVD, HF, CKD), hypoglycemia risk, and weight goals.
    - **High-Benefit Combo:** For patients with ASCVD/HF/CKD, combining **Metformin + SGLT2i + GLP-1 RA** offers maximal cardiorenal protection and potent glucose lowering.
    - **Intensification:** If triple therapy fails or A1c remains significantly elevated, initiate/intensify injectable therapy, typically starting with **basal insulin** once daily.

## T1DM
### Insulin
- Types![Pasted image 20231209112442.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231209112442.png)

>[!tip] 
>- Rapid acting insulin has to be injected before meal, so that its peak action coincides with the rise in blood glucose levels from the food.
>- Glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that forms insoluble complexes.  This leads to the formation of microprecipitates at the injection site that then slowly dissolve and are released into the circulation throughout the day.
- Regulation![L18230.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L18230.jpg)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insulin release is primarily stimulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. </span>
	- Parasympathetic stimulation of muscarinic M3 receptors promotes insulin secretion and is induced by the smell and/or sight of food.  
	- In contrast, sympathetic stimulation is more complex, since both alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors are present on pancreatic beta cells and exert opposite effects. 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alpha-2 receptor activation (dominant) inhibits insulin release during stress to maintain high glucose levels for vital tissues (brain, heart, etc.).</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Beta-2 receptor activation modestly promotes insulin secretion</span>, fine-tuning glucose regulation and preventing excessive hyperglycemia under moderate stress.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">However, the alpha-2-mediated inhibitory effect is predominant, causing sympathetic stimulation to lead to overall inhibition of insulin secretion.</span>
