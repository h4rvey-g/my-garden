# Etiology
- Genetic factors
	- Medullary carcinoma: associated with [[USMLE/Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias\|MEN2]] (RET gene mutations) or familial medullary carcinoma
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Papillary carcinoma: associated with RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF mutations</span>
	- Follicular carcinoma: associated with PAX8-PPAR-γ rearrangement and RAS mutation
	- Undifferentiated/anaplastic carcinoma: associated with TP53 mutation
- Ionizing radiation (particularly during childhood): mostly associated with papillary carcinoma

| **Prevalence**           | Most common (75-85% of thyroid cancers)                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Second most common (10-15% of thyroid cancers)                                                                                                                                                               | Rare (3-5% of thyroid cancers)                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Age of Onset**         | Can occur at any age, most often 30-50 years                                                                                                                                                                                            | Usually affects people older than 50 years                                                                                                                                                                   | Can occur at any age, sporadic cases often present later; hereditary cases can present earlier.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Spread (Metastasis)**  | Primarily spreads through lymphatics (to nearby lymph nodes)                                                                                                                                                                            | Primarily spreads through blood vessels (hematogenous spread) to lungs, bones, brain, liver. Less likely to spread to lymph nodes compared to PTC.                                                           | Can spread to lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bones. Early spread to regional lymph nodes is common.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Microscopic Features** | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Characteristic nuclear features: "Orphan Annie eye" nuclei (empty appearing), nuclear grooves, pseudoinclusions, psammoma bodies. Papillae (finger-like projections) are common.</span> | Follicular architecture (small, round structures).  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Invasion of the capsule or blood vessels is key for diagnosis.</span> Lacks the nuclear features of PTC. | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Solid nests of cells, may contain amyloid.</span> Cells stain positive for calcitonin, chromogranin A, and CEA. May have a variety of appearances (follicular, pseudopapillary, oncocytic). |
| **Hormone Production**   | Produces thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Produces Thyroglobulin.                                                                                                                                                                          | Produces thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Produces Thyroglobulin                                                                                                                                                | Produces calcitonin. Can also produce other hormones like corticotropin, serotonin, melanin, and prostaglandins.                                                                                                                            |
| **Prognosis**            | Generally excellent prognosis, especially in younger patients.                                                                                                                                                                          | Good prognosis, especially for small, minimally invasive tumors in young patients. Prognosis worsens with larger size, extensive vascular invasion, and older age.                                           | Variable; depends on stage and whether it's sporadic or hereditary. The 5 year survival rate is about 93% for stages I to III. Stage IV has worse prognosis with 28% for 5 year survival rate.                                              |
| **Other**                | Most common type associated with prior radiation exposure. Multifocality is common. The accuracy of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) is very high.                                                                                   | May arise from a pre-existing adenoma.                                                                                                                                                                       | Can be part of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes (MEN2A and MEN2B).                                                                                                                                                       |

>- **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC):** Originates from the **follicular cells** of the thyroid gland. These cells are responsible for producing thyroid hormones. PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer.
>- **Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC):** Also originates from the **follicular cells** of the thyroid gland. Follicular and Papillary carcinoma are differentiated thyroid cancers.
>- **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC):** Arises from the **parafollicular cells** (also known as **C cells**) of the thyroid gland. These cells are distinct from follicular cells, and they produce the hormone calcitonin, which is involved in calcium regulation. MTC is a neuroendocrine tumor.![Pasted image 20250310104250.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250310104250.png)

## Papillary thyroid carcinoma 
- Tissue of origin: Thyrocytes
- Well differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Most common type of thyroid cancer
	- Palpable lymph nodes due to metastatic spread (often detected before primary tumor)
	- May be multifocal
	- Very good prognosis
 - Pathology
	 - Psam<font color="#ffc000">moma</font> bodies![Pasted image 20231221165709.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231221165709.png)
		- Morphology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">concentric lamellar calcifications</span>
		- Occurrence: seen in diseases associated with calcific degeneration
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas (evidence of psammoma bodies in thyroid tissue should always raise suspicion of malignancy)
			- Serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and endometrium
			- Meningiomas
			- Mesotheliomas
	- **Intranuclear inclusions (pseudoinclusions):** These are not true inclusions of chromatin within the cytoplasm. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They are actually invaginations (infoldings) of the nuclear membrane (the envelope that surrounds the nucleus). Because of this infolding, cytoplasm appears to be _inside_ the nucleus</span>, but it's actually still separated from the nuclear material by the folded nuclear membrane.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nuclear grooves:</span> These are also invaginations of the nuclear envelope, creating a groove or fold in the nucleus. It gives a characteristic appearance sometimes likened to a "coffee bean".
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">“Orphan Annie” eyes nuclei</span>
		- Morphology: empty-appearing large oval nuclei with central clearing![Pasted image 20231221171132.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231221171132.png)
		- Occurrence
			- Papillary thyroid carcinomas
			- Autoimmune thyroiditis (e.g., Hashimoto disease, Grave disease)

## Follicular thyroid carcinoma
- Well differentiated
- Characteristics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hematogenous metastasis</span> especially to
		- Lungs
		- Bone (lytic lesions)
	- Rarely multifocal
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distinguishing a benign follicular adenoma from a well-differentiated follicular carcinoma depends on the presence of vascular or capsular invasion, which cannot be determined on a fine-needle aspiration specimen.</span>![Pasted image 20250310105522.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250310105522.png)![L49484.png](/img/user/appendix/L49484.png)
	- Good prognosis
## Medullary carcinoma
- Tissue of origin: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Parafollicular cells (C cells)</span>
	- The parafollicular cells are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">located in the connective tissue between the thyroid follicles, which can be considered a "medullary" (central) part of the thyroid gland</span>, although not in the same sense as the medulla in other organs like the adrenal glands.
- Poorly differentiated
- Characteristics
	- Sometimes a genetic predisposition → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Multiple endocrine neoplasias\|multiple endocrine neoplasia]] type 2 (MEN2)</span> (25% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Sporadic (75% of medullary carcinomas)
	- Produces [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|calcitonin]]![Pasted image 20240317093756.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240317093756.png)
- Pathology![highresdefault_L1488.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L1488.jpg)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ovoid cells of C cell origin and therefore without follicle development</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amyloid in the stroma (stains with Congo red)</span>
		- These amyloid deposits are derived from [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|calcitonin]] secreted by the neoplastic C cells
