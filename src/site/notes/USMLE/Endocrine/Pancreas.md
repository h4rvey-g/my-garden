# Microscopic anatomy

- **Exocrine Pancreas (approx. 85-99% of mass):** Composed of acinar cells and a ductal system.
    - **Acinar Cells:** Synthesize, store, and secrete digestive enzymes (zymogens like trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen; active enzymes like amylase, lipase). Arranged in clusters (acini).
    - **Ductal System:** Transports pancreatic juice. Lined by ductal cells that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize gastric acid.</span>
        - **Main Pancreatic Duct (Duct of Wirsung):** Runs the length of the pancreas from tail to head. Joins the common bile duct to form the **hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater)**, which empties into the 2nd part of the duodenum at the **major duodenal papilla**. Flow controlled by **Sphincter of Oddi**.
        - **Accessory Pancreatic Duct (Duct of Santorini):** Variable; when present, typically drains the lower part of the head and empties into the duodenum at the **minor duodenal papilla**, proximal to the major papilla. May communicate with the main duct.
- **Endocrine Pancreas (approx. 1-2% of mass):** Consists of **Islets of Langerhans**, scattered throughout the exocrine tissue (most numerous in the tail). Hormones secreted directly into the bloodstream.
    - **Alpha (α) cells (approx. 20%):** Secrete **glucagon** (↑ blood glucose).
    - **Beta (β) cells (approx. 75%):** Secrete **[[USMLE/Endocrine/Insulin\|insulin]]** (↓ blood glucose) and C-peptide.
    - **Delta (δ) cells (approx. 4-5%):** Secrete **somatostatin** (inhibits [[USMLE/Endocrine/Insulin\|insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, and GI hormone secretion).
    - **PP cells (F cells):** Secrete pancreatic polypeptide (regulates pancreatic secretions).
