# Microscopic anatomy

- **Exocrine Pancreas (approx. 85-99% of mass):** Composed of acinar cells and a ductal system.
    - **Acinar Cells:** Synthesize, store, and secrete digestive enzymes (zymogens like trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen; active enzymes like amylase, lipase). Arranged in clusters (acini).
    - **Ductal System:** Transports pancreatic juice. Lined by ductal cells that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid to neutralize gastric acid.</span>
        - **Main Pancreatic Duct (Duct of Wirsung):** Runs the length of the pancreas from tail to head. Joins the common bile duct to form the **hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater)**, which empties into the 2nd part of the duodenum at the **major duodenal papilla**. Flow controlled by **Sphincter of Oddi**.
        - **Accessory Pancreatic Duct (Duct of Santorini):** Variable; when present, typically drains the lower part of the head and empties into the duodenum at the **minor duodenal papilla**, proximal to the major papilla. May communicate with the main duct.
- **Endocrine Pancreas (approx. 1-2% of mass):** Consists of **Islets of Langerhans**, scattered throughout the exocrine tissue (most numerous in the tail). Hormones secreted directly into the bloodstream.
    - **Alpha (α) cells (approx. 20%):** Secrete **glucagon** (↑ blood glucose).
    - **Beta (β) cells (approx. 75%):** Secrete **[[USMLE/Endocrine/Insulin\|insulin]]** (↓ blood glucose) and C-peptide.
    - **Delta (δ) cells (approx. 4-5%):** Secrete **somatostatin** (inhibits [[USMLE/Endocrine/Insulin\|insulin]], glucagon, growth hormone, and GI hormone secretion).
    - **PP cells (F cells):** Secrete pancreatic polypeptide (regulates pancreatic secretions).

# Pancreatic Enzymes

## Key Enzymes & Function
The exocrine pancreas secretes digestive enzymes crucial for macronutrient breakdown in the duodenum.

*   **Amylase**: Digests starch and glycogen (carbohydrates) into simple sugars.
*   **Lipase**: Hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides. Requires bile for optimal function.
*   **Proteases**: Secreted as inactive zymogens to prevent pancreatic autodigestion.
    *   **Trypsinogen**: Converted to active **trypsin**. Trypsin is the primary activator of other pancreatic zymogens.
    *   **Chymotrypsinogen**: Converted to active **chymotrypsin**.
    *   **Procarboxypeptidases**: Converted to active **carboxypeptidases**.
    *   **Proelastase**: Converted to active **elastase**.

## Regulation of Secretion
Secretion is hormonally and neurally regulated, primarily during the intestinal phase of digestion.

*   **Cholecystokinin (CCK)**:
    *   **Stimulus**: Presence of fatty acids and amino acids in the duodenum.
    *   **Action**: Stimulates **acinar cells** to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice.
*   **Secretin**:
    *   **Stimulus**: High acidity (low pH) of chyme entering the duodenum.
    *   **Action**: Stimulates **ductal cells** to secrete bicarbonate-rich fluid (HCO₃⁻), which neutralizes stomach acid and provides an optimal pH for enzymatic activity.
*   **Vagal stimulation** (Ach): Also stimulates acinar cell secretion.

## Zymogen Activation Cascade
This is a critical, sequential process that occurs in the duodenal lumen to prevent premature activation within the pancreas.

1.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Enteropeptidase** (formerly enterokinase), a brush border enzyme, converts **trypsinogen** to **trypsin**.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Works best in the **slightly alkaline pH (~8.0)**</span>
2.  **Trypsin** then catalyzes the activation of all other pancreatic zymogens (chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidases, etc.), including more trypsinogen (auto-activation).

- **Protective mechanisms** to limit premature trypsinogen activation:
	- **Serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1)**:
		- Secreted by pancreatic acinar cells.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Functions as a trypsin inhibitor, impeding prematurely activated trypsinogen molecules within the pancreas.</span>
	- **Trypsin self-inhibition**:
		- Trypsin can cleave active trypsin molecules at a second site, rendering them inactive.
- **Hereditary pancreatitis**:
	- Rare disorder caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mutations in the **trypsinogen** or **SPINK1** gene.</span>
	- Common mutation results in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">abnormal trypsin that is not susceptible to inactivating cleavage by trypsin.</span>
