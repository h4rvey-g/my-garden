# Etiology
## Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (De Quervain thyroiditis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Viral infections</span>: [[USMLE/Infective disease/Mumps\|mumps]] virus, coxsackie virus, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|influenza]] virus, echovirus, adenovirus
## Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">≈ Postpartum thyroiditis</span>)
Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis is characterized by damage to follicular cells with lymphocytic infiltration resembling [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hashimoto thyroiditis\|Hashimoto thyroiditis]], rather than granuloma formation. 
- Drugs: α-[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Interferons and Tumor necrosis factor\|interferon]], lithium, amiodarone, interleukin-2, tyrosine kinase inhibitors
- Autoimmune disease 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postpartum thyroiditis</span>
	- Affects approx. 5% of women
	- Most prevalent in women with:
		- Type 1 [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]]
		- History of postpartum thyroiditis
		- Increased titers of thyroid peroxidase antibodies
	- Occurs within 1–12 months of delivery
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pregnancy causes a natural state of immunosuppression. After delivery, the immune system can rebound, leading to the flare-up of an underlying autoimmune process in susceptible women.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Manifests with a period of transient thyrotoxicosis followed by [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]] without thyroid enlargement or tenderness</span>
	- Associated with increased titers of thyroid peroxidase antibodies.
	- Usually resolves spontaneously.

# Pathophysiology
Subacute thyroiditis typically follows an acute viral illness and is thought to be due to a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cross-reacting immune response against viral proteins or tissue antigens released during cellular injury. </span>
1. <font color="#ffc000">Thyrotoxic phase</font>
	- Lasts 2–8 weeks
	- Caused by damage to follicular cells and the release of pre-formed colloid (stored thyroid hormones)
2. <font color="#ffc000">Hypothyroid phase</font>
	- Typically lasts 2–8 weeks; permanent in ∼ 15% of individuals with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis 
	- Caused by depletion of pre-formed colloid and impaired synthesis of new thyroid hormones as a result of damage to follicular cells
3. <font color="#ffc000">Euthyroid phase</font>: Thyroid function recovers and pathological changes are no longer visible in the thyroid gland.
>[!tip] 
>The disease is self-limiting in most cases but a few patients may experience relapses, and permanent [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]] occurs in ∼ 15% of cases!

# Clinical features
## Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (De Quervain thyroiditis)
- Possible <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">history of upper respiratory tract infections</span> a few weeks prior to the onset of subacute thyroiditis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Very painful, diffuse, firm [[USMLE/Endocrine/Goiter\|goiter]], jaw pain </span>
- Fever and/or malaise may be present.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Features of [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]] followed by features of [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Hypothyroidism\|hypothyroidism]]</span>
>[!Mnemonic] 
>- De Quer<font color="#ffc000">vain</font> causes <font color="#ffc000">pain</font>.
>- Associate the pain, fever with viral infection.

## Subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless</span>, diffuse, firm [[USMLE/Endocrine/Goiter\|goiter]] (thyroid size may be normal)
	- The terms “silent” or “painless” thyroiditis are often used to describe subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis.

# Diagnostics
- Thyroid function tests 
	- Thyrotoxic phase: ↑ T3 and T4 , ↑ thyroglobulin, ↓ TSH
		- The T4/T3 ratio is higher than in [[USMLE/Endocrine/Graves disease\|Grave's disease]].
	- Hypothyroid phase: ↓ T3 and T4, ↑ TSH
- Confirmatory test
	- ↑ ESR 
	- Radioiodine uptake study : ↓ iodine uptake 
		- Iodine uptake decreases for two reasons: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">1. Follicular cells are damaged and unable to take up iodine; 2. TSH secretion is initially suppressed as a result of thyrotoxicosis.</span> Radioiodine uptake returns to normal when TSH begins to rise during the hypothyroid phase. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased iodine uptake is another important feature that differentiates [[USMLE/Endocrine/Graves disease\| Graves thyrotoxicosis]] from thyrotoxicosis that occurs with subacute thyroiditis.</span>
