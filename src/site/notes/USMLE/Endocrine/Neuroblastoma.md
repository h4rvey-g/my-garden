Neuroblastoma is a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">malignant, embryonal neuroendocrine neoplasm of the sympathetic nervous system that originates from neural crest cells</span>, potentially secretes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">catecholamines</span>, and is usually found in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">adrenal glands or sympathetic ganglia.</span>
# Epidemiology
- Most common malignancy of the adrenal medulla <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in infants</span>
- Mean age at diagnosis: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">1–2 years</span>

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amplification and overexpression of oncogene MYCN (N-myc)</span>

# Clinical features
## General symptoms
- Failure to thrive or weight loss
- Fever
- Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite
## Localized symptoms
### Primary Tumor Locations and Symptoms
- **Abdomen (in > 60% of cases)**
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In adults, pheochromocytoma is the most common tumor of the adrenal medulla, while in children it is neuroblastoma.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Palpable, firm, irregular abdominal mass</span> that may cross the midline (in contrast to nephroblastoma, which is smooth and usually does not cross the midline)
- **Chest (in ∼ 20% of cases): particularly paravertebral ganglia**
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spinal cord compression</span> → back pain, weakness, numbness, ataxia, loss of bowel or bladder control
	- Scoliosis
	- Dyspnea, cough
	- Inspiratory stridor
- **Neck**
	- Horner syndrome
### Metastases Locations and Symptoms
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Orbit of the eye**</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Periorbital ecchymoses ("raccoon eyes")</span>![Pasted image 20250323162124.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250323162124.png)
	- Proptosis
- **Bones**
	- Bone pain
	- Anemia (bone marrow suppression)

- **Skin**
	- Subcutaneous nodules
## [[USMLE/Respiratory/Paraneoplastic syndromes\|Paraneoplastic syndromes]]
- Chronic [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]] → electrolyte imbalances 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia: a [[USMLE/Respiratory/Paraneoplastic syndromes\|paraneoplastic syndrome]] of unclear etiology characterized by rapid and multi-directional eye movements, rhythmic jerks of the limbs, and ataxia (dancing eyes dancing feet syndrome) </span>
- Possibly hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations, sweating, flushing  (hypertension is more commonly seen in pheochromocytoma)

# Diagnostics
## Laboratory tests
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Urine</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Catecholamine metabolites</span> homovanillic acid (HVA) and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) in 24-hour urine
- Blood
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Catecholamine metabolites (HVA/VMA)</span>
	- ↑ Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE)
