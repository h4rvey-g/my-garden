## Risk factors
- Chronic hyperglycemia promotes <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nerve injury</span> and impairs nerve repair in distal sensory fibers, causing <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased sensation of pain, pressure, and proprioception.</span>
- Loss of these protective senses can cause individuals to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not recognize an injury</span> due to minor trauma, friction, or pressure.
