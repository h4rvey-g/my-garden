# Etiology

# Pathophysiology
- Multiple somatic mutations of TSH receptor occur in long-standing goiters (> 60% of cases) → autonomous functioning of some nodules (toxic MNG) → [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]] (due to ↑ release of both T3 and T4)

---
# Clinical features
- Painless [[USMLE/Endocrine/Goiter\|goiter]] with multiple palpable nodules 
- Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased radioiodine uptake by multiple hyperfunctioning (hot) nodules</span>
