- **Classic Triad:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Episodic</span> **P**alpitations, **H**eadache, and **D**iaphoresis (sweating). This triad combined with hypertension is highly suggestive. 
- **Hypertension:** Can be sustained or paroxysmal (episodic) and is the clinical hallmark. May present as a hypertensive crisis.
- **Other Symptoms (the "5 Ps"):** In addition to the triad, patients may experience high **P**ressure (HTN) and **P**allor. Anxiety, a sense of impending doom, tremor, and weight loss are also common.
