# Definition
- Thyrotoxicosis: a hypermetabolic condition caused by an inappropriately high level of circulating thyroid hormones irrespective of the source. 
- Hyperthyroidism: a condition characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the overproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland</span>; can cause thyrotoxicosis
	- Overt hyperthyroidism
		- ↓ Serum TSH levels with ↑ serum free T4 and/or T3 levels
		- Patients typically experience symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
		- E.g., [[USMLE/Endocrine/Graves disease\|Graves disease]], [[USMLE/Endocrine/Toxic multinodular goiter\|toxic MNG]], and toxic adenoma
	- Subclinical hyperthyroidism
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Serum TSH levels with normal serum free T4 and T3 levels</span>
		- Patients are normally <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May progress to overt hyperthyroidism</span>
		- If the negative feedback regulation mechanism is intact, increased T3 and T4 lead to TSH suppression, which in turn leads to reduced stimulation of thyroid follicular cells. Thyroid hormone levels may then be normal.

1. Synthesis of thyroglobulin (TG)
2. Uptake of iodide 
3. Iodination of thyroglobulin
	- Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) 
		1. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oxidation of iodide (I<sup>-</sup> → I<sub>2</sub>)</span>
		2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Organification of the generated I<sub>2</sub> by covalently linking it with the tyrosine residues present in TG.</span>
			- Generates single (TG + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = monoiodotyrosine, MIT) or double-iodinated species of tyrosine (TG-MIT + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = diiodotyrosine, DIT) 
		3. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Coupling reaction: conjugation of iodinated tyrosine residues</span>
			1. Two DIT molecules form tetraiodothyronine: DIT + DIT = T4
			2. One MIT and one DIT form triiodothyronine: MIT + DIT = T3
4. Storage
5. Release
6. Transport
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most of the circulating thyroid hormones are inactive and bound to transport proteins. Only a very small fraction (∼ 0.3%) is unbound and biologically active.</span>
	- Transport protein: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG)</span>
		- TBG binds most of the serum T3/T4. 
		- The bound fraction of T3/T4 is biologically inactive.
		- Hyperestrogenemia (e.g., pregnancy, OCP use) → ↑ TBG synthesis → ↓ free T3/T4 in serum → ↑ thyroid hormone synthesis
		- Hypoproteinemia (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, chronic liver disease) → ↓ TBG synthesis → ↑ free T3/T4 in serum → ↓ thyroid hormone synthesis

# Clinical features

- Musculoskeletal
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fine [[USMLE/Neurology/Tremor\|tremor]] of the outstretched fingers</span>
	- Hyperthyroid myopathy: a condition of muscle weakness, pain, and atrophy associated with hyperthyroidism (e.g., from [[USMLE/Endocrine/Graves disease\|Graves disease]], thyroiditis)
		- Predominantly affects individuals > 40 years of age
		- Can develop acutely or several weeks to months after the onset of hyperthyroidism.
		- Typically affects proximal muscles (e.g., hip flexors, quadriceps) more than distal muscles
		- Serum creatine kinase levels are most often normal
- Osteopathy: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]]</span> due to the direct effect of T3 on osteoclastic bone resorption, fractures (in the elderly)
	- In <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">long-standing hyperthyroidism</span>
- Endocrinological
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Female: oligo/amenorrhoea, anovulatory infertility, dysfunctional uterine bleeding </span>
		- Serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are high in hyperthyroidism → low serum free (unbound) estradiol concentrations
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Male: [[USMLE/Reproductive/Gynecomastia\|gynecomastia]], decreased libido, infertility, erectile dysfunction </span>

# Treatment
![Pasted image 20240413093315.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240413093315.png)
## Thionamides
- Examples	
	- Methimazole (MMI)
	- Carbimazole
	- Propylthiouracil (PTU)
- Mechanism of action
	- Inhibits thyroid hormone production via <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inhibition of thyroid peroxidase → blockade of iodide oxidation, organification, coupling</span>
	- Propylthiouracil also lowers peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 by inhibiting 5'-deiodinase.
- Adverse effects
	- Allergy/hypersensitivity
		- The most common side effect is a pruritic rash (particularly with methimazole)
	- Hematologic side effects
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agranulocytosis</span>
			- Rare but dangerous (affects ∼ 0.5% of patients; more common in elderly and those taking high doses)
			- Rapidly reversible with discontinuation of treatment
		- [[USMLE/Blood/Aplastic anemia\|Aplastic anemia]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatotoxicity (seen with propylthiouracil use)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Teratogenicity: increased risk of congenital malformations with carbimazole and methimazole (e.g., aplasia cutis)</span>

>[!tip] 
>As methimazole and carbimazole are [[USMLE/Reproductive/Teratogenesis\|teratogenic]], <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">propylthiouracil is recommended in the first trimester. After the first trimester, switch back to carbimazole or methimazole</span> because of the hepatotoxic effects of propylthiouracil.
## Potassium iodides
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In the event of a nuclear accident, potassium iodide is given prophylactically to protect the thyroid from excessive accumulation of radioactive <sup>131</sup>I.</span>
