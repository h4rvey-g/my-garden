- Renal glucose reabsorption 
	- Free filtration of glucose by the kidneys
	- Complete reabsorption (urine normally is glucose-free) in the proximal tubules via two types of SGLT 
		- A membrane protein that mediates glucose and sodium transport across apical cell membranes in the small intestine and kidneys.
		- Utilizes the energy provided by the sodium gradient across the cell membrane for active glucose transport.
		- SGLT1
			- Reabsorbs the remaining glucose (∼ 2%) as well as galactose in the PCT
			- One molecule of glucose is absorbed together with two molecules of sodium
		- SGLT2
			- Reabsorbs ∼ 98% of urinary glucose in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT)

	- Reabsorption also relies on a sodium concentration gradient via Na+/K+ ATPase.
# Glucose transporters (GLUTs)

- GLUT-1 contributes to basal glucose transport in erythrocytes and at the blood-brain barrier.
- GLUT-2 is present in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and at the basolateral membrane of renal tubules and small intestinal mucosa.  It plays a role in absorption of dietary glucose, reabsorption of glucose from renal tubules, hepatic glucose regulation, and sensitivity of beta cells to circulating glucose.
- GLUT-3 is involved in placental and neuronal glucose transport.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">GLUT-4 is present in adipose tissue, and skeletal & heart muscle</span>

	- Plays a key role in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">regulating body glucose homeostasis</span>

- GLUT-5 is a fructose transporter found in spermatocytes and the gastrointestinal tract.
