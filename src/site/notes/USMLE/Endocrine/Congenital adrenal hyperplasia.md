- There are three subtypes of CAH:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">21β-hydroxylase (∼ 95% of CAH)</span>
	- 11β-hydroxylase (∼ 5% of CAH)
	- 17α-hydroxylase (rare)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Foa all 3 subtypes, cortisol production is defected.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low levels of cortisol → lack of negative feedback to the pituitary → increased ACTH → adrenal hyperplasia and increased synthesis of adrenal precursor steroids</span>

$^a$All congenital adrenal enzyme deficiencies are autosomal recessive disorders and most are characterized by skin hyperpigmentation (due to $\uparrow$ MSH production, which is coproduced and secreted with ACTH) and bilateral adrenal gland enlargement (due to $\uparrow$ ACTH stimulation).
$^b$Results in $\uparrow$ BP.

>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">DOC (11-Deoxycorticosterone) has aldosterone-like activity</span>, and in high levels, it causes hypertension and kaluresis and inhibits the production of renin and consequently aldosterone.

>[!Mnemonic] 
>- “1 DOC:” If the deficient enzyme starts with 1 (11β-, 17‑), there is increased DOC.
>- “AND 1:” If the deficient enzyme ends with 1 (21-, 11β‑), androgens are increased.

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated in all forms of CAH.</span>
- Specific treatment
	- 21β-hydroxylase deficiency
		- Lifelong fludrocortisone therapy (aldosterone substitution)
		- Sodium chloride (salt) supplements, especially during infancy and childhood
	- 11β-hydroxylase deficiency
		- Spironolactone to block mineralocorticoid receptors
		- Reduced dietary sodium intake
	- 17α-hydroxylase deficiency
		- Spironolactone to block mineralocorticoid receptors
		- Estrogen replacement therapy for female genotype; may be started in early puberty
		- Reduced dietary sodium intake
