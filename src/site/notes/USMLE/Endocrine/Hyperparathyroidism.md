# Primary hyperparathyroidism
## Etiology
- Parathyroid gland adenoma (∼ 85%): benign tumor of the parathyroid glands

---
# Clinical features
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptomatic patients often have clinical features of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypercalcemia\|hypercalcemia]]</span>

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Renal/Nephrolithiasis\|Nephrolithiasis]]</span>, nephrocalcinosis (calcium oxalate > calcium phosphate stones)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bone pain</span>, arthralgias, myalgias, fractures
	- Because most of the calcium is released from bones
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Constipation</span>
	- Increase in extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> → membrane potential outside is more positive → more amount of depolarization is needed to initiate action potential → decreased excitability of muscle and nerve tissue
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal pain</span>
- Nausea and vomiting
- Anorexia
- [[USMLE/GI/Peptic ulcer disease\|Peptic ulcer disease]]
	- hypercalcemia-induced increase of gastric acid secretion and gastrin levels.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction</span>
- Diminished muscle excitability
	- Cardiac arrhythmias
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ECG: Shorten QT interval</span>, see [[USMLE/Cardiology/ECGs#QT interval\|ECGs#QT interval]]
	- Muscle weakness, paresis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Polyuria and dehydration</span>
	- Due to acquired renal ADH resistance. Although ADH is being secreted, the kidneys no longer respond to it adequately (nephrogenic [[USMLE/Renal/Diabetes insipidus\|diabetes insipidus]]).

## Diagnostics
---
- Neck imaging
	- For surgical planning to determine the location of the abnormal glands and evaluate for concomitant thyroid disease
	- Options include ultrasound neck and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nuclear imaging, i.e., Tc-99m sestamibi scan.</span>
- X-ray
	- Decreased bone mineral density
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cortical thinning</span>: especially prominent in the phalanges of the hand; manifests as acroosteolysis (a subperiosteal pattern of bone resorption)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unlike the typical [[USMLE/MSK/Osteoporosis\|osteoporosis]] of [[USMLE/Pathology/Aging changes\|aging]], which predominantly affects trabecular bone</span>
	- Salt and pepper skull: granular decalcification manifesting as diffusely distributed lytic foci on imaging of the calvarium 
	- Features of osteitis fibrosa cystica
## Complications
### Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC)
- A rare skeletal disorder seen in advanced hyperparathyroidism characterized by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">replacement of calcified bone with fibrous tissue</span>
- Most commonly seen in primary hyperparathyroidism but can also occur in secondary hyperparathyroidism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ PTH → ↑ RANK ligand expression → activation of osteoclasts → bone resorption, cortical bone destruction, and fibrous tissue deposition</span>
- Features include bone pain, subperiosteal thinning, and bone cysts; multiple bone cysts in the skull may result in a salt and pepper skull (pepper pot) appearance on x-ray.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In advanced OFC, large, cystic, vascular cavities with a tumor-like appearance on x-ray and a brown color due to hemosiderin deposition (brown tumors) can form in long bones.</span>![Pasted image 20231003162733.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231003162733.png)
