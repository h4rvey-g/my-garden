Serum sickness is a classic example of a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions\|type III hypersensitivity reaction]]</span>, which usually develops as a complication of antitoxin or antivenom administration.
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antivenom or antitoxin containing animal proteins or serum</span> (�?“serum�?sickness), such as:
	- Equine anti-snake venom
	- Equine anti-spider venom
	- Equine or bovine anti-[[USMLE/Infective disease/Rabies\|rabies]] antitoxin
	- Equine botulinum antitoxin
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Medications: most frequently [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|antibiotics]] (e.g., penicillin, amoxicillin, cefaclor, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) </span>
- Infections: [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|Hepatitis B]] virus

# Pathophysiology
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Exposure to an antigen (e.g., antivenom, drug) �?formation of antibodies �?deposition of antibody-antigen complexes in tissue �?activation of the [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] cascade �?tissue damage and systemic inflammation</span>

# Clinical features
- Fever
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rash (urticarial or purpuric)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Arthralgias, myalgia</span>
- Lymphadenopathy
>[!tip] 
><span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms appear 1�? weeks following initial exposure</span> (because antibodies take several days to form) and typically resolve within a few weeks after discontinuation of the offending agent.

# Diagnostics
- Histologic examination of affected tissues typically shows <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">small vessel [[USMLE/MSK/Vasculitides\|vasculitis]] with fibrinoid necrosis and intense neutrophil infiltration</span>.  
- Deposition of IgG and/or IgM [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]]-fixing antibodies results in localized [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] consumption and hypocomplementemia (decreased serum C3 levels).
# Differential Diagnostics
## Serum sickness-like reaction
- Epidemiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">much more common than actual serum sickness</span>
- Etiology: similar to that of serum sickness
	- Infections (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|hepatitis B]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Rabies\|rabies]])
	- Medications that can act as haptens (e.g., allopurinol, cephalosporins, penicillin)
- Pathogenesis: unclear (likely not the result of a [[USMLE/Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions\|type III hypersensitivity reaction]])
- Clinical features
	- Similar to classic serum sickness
