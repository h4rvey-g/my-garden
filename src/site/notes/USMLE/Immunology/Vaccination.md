# 1. Live Attenuated Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contain a weakened (attenuated) form of the live virus or bacterium. Must replicate in the host to be effective. Induces a robust and long-lasting **humoral and cell-mediated** immune response.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Strong, often lifelong immunity** with fewer doses.
    - **Risk**: Can revert to a virulent form (rare) and may cause disease in immunocompromised individuals.
- **Contraindications**: **Immunocompromised** patients (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]] with CD4 <200, chemotherapy, [[USMLE/Immunology/Severe combined immunodeficiency\|SCID]]) and **pregnant women**.
- **Examples**:
    - **M**easles, **M**umps, **R**ubella (MMR).
    - Varicella (chickenpox).
    - Rotavirus.
    - Sabin [[USMLE/MSK/Poliomyelitis\|polio]] vaccine (oral, not used in the US).
    - Yellow fever.
    - [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|Influenza]] (intranasal).
    - BCG (for [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|TB]], not used as a vaccine in the US).

# 2. Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contain whole bacteria or viruses that have been killed by heat or chemicals. The pathogen cannot replicate.
- **Key Features**:
    - Induces a primarily **humoral** (antibody-mediated) immune response.
    - Safer than live vaccines; cannot cause disease.
    - Weaker immune response; often requires **boosters**.
- **Examples**:
    - **[[USMLE/MSK/Poliomyelitis\|Polio]]** (Salk, injected).
    - **[[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis A\|Hepatitis A]]**.
    - **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Rabies\|Rabies]]**.
    - [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|Influenza]] (injected).

# 3. Subunit, Recombinant, Polysaccharide, and Conjugate Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contain only specific antigenic components of a pathogen (e.g., proteins, polysaccharides, capsids), not the entire organism.
- **Key Features**:
    - Very safe, as they cannot cause disease.
    - May require boosters and adjuvants (substances that enhance the immune response).
- **Types & Examples**:
    - **Subunit/Recombinant**: A piece of the pathogen's DNA is inserted into a manufacturing cell (like yeast) to produce the antigen.
        - **[[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|Hepatitis B]]** (HBsAg).
        - **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Human papillomavirus infection\|Human Papillomavirus]] ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Human papillomavirus infection\|HPV]])**.
        - Acellular [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pertussis\|Pertussis]] (in DTaP/Tdap).
        - [[USMLE/Infective disease/Shingles\|Shingles]] (recombinant zoster vaccine).
    - **Polysaccharide**: Contain the polysaccharide capsule of [[USMLE/Blood/Asplenia\|encapsulated bacteria]]. Elicits a T-cell-independent immune response, which is weak in infants/young children.
        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax).</span>
    - **Conjugate**: A polysaccharide antigen is chemically linked (conjugated) to a carrier protein. This process converts the immune response to T-cell-dependent, inducing a stronger and more robust response, especially in infants.
        - **_[[USMLE/Infective disease/Haemophilus influenzae\|Haemophilus influenzae]]_ type b (Hib)**.
        - **Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevnar)**.
        - **Meningococcal vaccine**.

# 4. Toxoid Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: Contain an inactivated bacterial toxin (toxoid). The immune system develops antibodies against the toxin, not the organism itself.
- **Key Features**:
    - Protects against diseases caused by bacterial toxins.
    - Requires boosters.
- **Examples**:
    - **_Clostridium tetani_** ([[USMLE/Neurology/Tetanus\|Tetanus]]).
    - **_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_** ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Diphtheria\|Diphtheria]]).
    - Included in DTaP, Tdap, and DT vaccines.

# 5. mRNA Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: A lipid nanoparticle delivers mRNA encoding a specific viral antigen (e.g., the spike protein). The host cell's machinery translates the mRNA to produce the antigen, which then stimulates an immune response.
- **Key Features**:
    - Rapid development and production.
    - Induces both humoral and cellular immunity.
    - No risk of infection as it does not contain any live virus. The mRNA does not integrate into the host genome.
- **Examples**:
    - **COVID-19** (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna).

# 6. Viral Vector Vaccines
- **Mechanism**: A modified, harmless virus (the vector, e.g., adenovirus) is used to deliver genetic code for an antigen into host cells, which then produce the antigen to trigger an immune response.
- **Key Features**:
    - Generates a strong immune response.
    - Can be developed relatively quickly.
- **Examples**:
    - **COVID-19** (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, AstraZeneca).
    - **Ebola virus** (Ervebo).
