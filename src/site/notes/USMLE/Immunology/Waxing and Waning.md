1. **Multiple Sclerosis (MS)**:
    
    - **Presentation:** Neurological deficits (e.g., optic neuritis, sensory loss, motor weakness, diplopia, vertigo) that are separated in _time_ and _space_. The classic relapsing-remitting form involves episodes (flares/waxing) of neurological dysfunction followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remission/waning).
    - **Why High Yield:** Classic autoimmune demyelinating disease, tests concepts in neurology, immunology, and pathology.
2. **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)**:
    
    - **Presentation:** A multi-system autoimmune disease characterized by flares (waxing) involving various organs (skin rash, arthritis, nephritis, serositis, hematologic abnormalities) followed by periods of relative quiescence (waning), though often with underlying chronic activity.
    - **Why High Yield:** Prototypical systemic autoimmune disease, tests immunology (Type II & III hypersensitivity), multi-organ pathology.  
        
3. **Myasthenia Gravis (MG)**:
    
    - **Presentation:** Muscle weakness, particularly affecting ocular (ptosis, diplopia) and bulbar muscles, that _worsens with repeated use_ throughout the day (waxing) and _improves with rest_ (waning).
    - **Why High Yield:** Tests neuromuscular junction physiology, autoimmunity (anti-AChR antibodies), pharmacology (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors).
4. **Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD - Crohn's Disease & Ulcerative Colitis)**:
    
    - **Presentation:** Chronic inflammatory conditions of the GI tract characterized by periods of active inflammation (flares/waxing - diarrhea, abdominal pain, bleeding) interspersed with periods of remission (waning).
    - **Why High Yield:** Common GI pathology, tests immunology, pathology, and distinguishing features between Crohn's and UC.
5. **Gout**:
    
    - **Presentation:** Episodic attacks (flares/waxing) of severe, acute arthritis (often podagra - big toe) due to monosodium urate crystal deposition, followed by asymptomatic intercritical periods (waning).
    - **Why High Yield:** Tests concepts in biochemistry (purine metabolism), pathology (crystal arthropathy), pharmacology (treatments like NSAIDs, colchicine, allopurinol).
6. **<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Follicular Lymphoma</span>**:
    
    - **Presentation:** Often described as an _indolent_ (slow-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patients may present with painless lymphadenopathy that can spontaneously increase and decrease in size over months or years, even without treatment (waxing and waning lymph node size).</span>
    - **Why High Yield:** Tests hematology/oncology concepts, specific translocation t(14;18), BCL-2 overexpression, histology.
7. **Hodgkin Lymphoma (Pel-Ebstein Fevers)**:
    
    - **Presentation:** While not the entire disease course, a subset of patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma experience Pel-Ebstein fevers: cyclical fevers that increase (waxing) for several days to weeks, followed by afebrile periods (waning) of similar duration. This specific _symptom_ waxes and wanes.  
        
    - **Why High Yield:** Classic hematologic malignancy, Reed-Sternberg cells, distinct subtypes, constitutional "B symptoms" (fever, night sweats, weight loss).
