- Description 
	- Phagocytes (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes) ingest pathogens
	- Activation of the NADPH oxidase complex generates and releases reactive oxygen species (ROS; free radicals) that destroy the pathogens in phagosomes
- Mechanism![Pasted image 20250707175651.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250707175651.png)
	- NADPH oxidase complex
		- Can generate oxygen radicals (•O2–) from O2, but also to neutralize them
		- Defective NADPH oxidase leads to [[USMLE/Immunology/Chronic granulomatous disease\|chronic granulomatous disease]].
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Superoxide dismutase: generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from •O2–</span>
	- Myeloperoxidase: an enzyme in neutrophil granulocytes
		- Generates hydroxyl-halide radicals (HCl•O) from H2O2 and Cl-
		- Contains heme pigment responsible for the occasionally blue-green color of pus and sputum
	- Release of oxidative burst causes K+ influx, which triggers secretion of lysosomal enzymes into the phagosome.

| **1** | **Hydroxyl Radical (•OH)**   | **Extreme**        | Most biologically reactive ROS; formed from H₂O₂ via the **Fenton Reaction**. |
| **2** | **Hypochlorous Acid (HOCl)** | **Very High**      | "Bleach"; produced by **myeloperoxidase** in neutrophils to kill pathogens.   |
| **3** | **Superoxide (O₂•⁻)**        | **Moderate**       | Initial ROS made by **NADPH oxidase** in the respiratory burst.               |
| **4** | **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)** | **Low**            | Stable precursor to •OH and HOCl; can diffuse across membranes.               |

- Clinical significance
	- Respiratory burst is a vital component of innate immune response
	- Impaired respiratory burst leads to an elevated risk of infection with catalase-positive pathogens (e.g., [[USMLE/Respiratory/Aspergillosis\|Aspergillus]], S. aureus).
	- Normally, phagocytes can transform H2O2 generated by invading pathogens into ROS.
	- Catalase-positive organisms can degrade their own H2O2, leaving phagocytes without substrate to convert.
	- P. aeruginosa uses pyocyanin  to form ROS and eliminate competing organisms.
