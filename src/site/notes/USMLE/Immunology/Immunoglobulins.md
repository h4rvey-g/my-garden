B-lymphocytes rearrange their V, D, and J gene segments to create diverse antibodies. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T-lymphocytes, however, only rearrange their T-cell receptor genes.</span> Consequently, in T-cells, the immunoglobulin genes remain in their original, unrearranged "germline" state.

Fab fragments contain a variable domain and the first constant region from a heavy and light chain; because they do not contain an Fc receptor, Fab fragments cannot trigger cell killing via [[USMLE/Immunology/Complement system\|complement]] or phagocytosis.

# Hinge Region of Immunoglobulin
-   **Structure & Location**
	*   A short, flexible stretch of amino acids located between the **Cμ1** and **Cμ2** domains of the heavy chains.
	*   Connects the two antigen-binding **Fab arms** to the **Fc portion** of the antibody.
	*   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Present in **IgG, IgA,** and **IgD**.</span>
	*   **Absent in IgM and IgE**, which instead have an additional constant domain (Cμ2) that confers flexibility.![Pasted image 20250712175636.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250712175636.png)

-   **Composition**
    *   Rich in **proline** residues, which prevent tight folding and provide flexibility.
    *   Rich in **cysteine** residues, which form interchain **disulfide bonds** that link the two heavy chains.

-   **Function**
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Flexibility:** Primary function. Allows the two Fab arms to move independently, enabling them to bind to epitopes separated by variable distances.</span>![L69890.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L69890.jpg)
	    * **Affinity = Attraction** (Strength of a _single_ bond)
		- **Avidity = Adhesion** (Overall strength of _all_ bonds combined)
    *   **Complement Activation:** Flexibility influences the ability of the Fc region to bind C1q and initiate the classical complement cascade.
    *   **Fc Receptor Binding:** Affects the interaction with Fc receptors on phagocytes, NK cells, and other immune cells, thus modulating effector functions like opsonization and ADCC.
    *   **Site of Proteolytic Cleavage:** Highly susceptible to cleavage by proteases (e.g., papain, pepsin), which is used experimentally to separate Fab and Fc fragments.

-   **Isotype & Subclass Variations (High-Yield)**
    *   **IgG3:** Has the **longest and most flexible hinge region**, making it the most potent IgG subclass for complement activation but also most susceptible to proteolysis.
    *   **IgG2:** Has a shorter, more rigid hinge due to multiple disulfide bonds, resulting in less flexibility.
    *   **IgA1 vs. IgA2:**
        *   **IgA1:** Found in serum; has a long, proline-rich hinge region. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This makes it susceptible to cleavage by **IgA proteases** produced by bacteria like *S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Neisseria* (*S.H.i.N.*), which is a key virulence mechanism.</span>
        *   **IgA2:** Found in mucosal secretions; has a short hinge lacking the protease-sensitive site, making it resistant to cleavage.

-   **Clinical Correlations / Buzzwords**
    *   **Bacterial Immune Evasion:** Cleavage of secretory IgA1 at the hinge region by bacterial IgA proteases allows pathogens to colonize mucosal surfaces.
    *   **IgG Subclass Deficiency:** Different hinge structures lead to different effector functions. IgG3 deficiency can lead to recurrent infections due to impaired complement activation.

- IgM

- IgG

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neutralization of viruses and bacterial toxins, preventing the virus from entering host cells.</span>
- IgA
	- Found especially on mucosal surfaces and in bodily fluids like saliva, mucus, tears and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">breast milk </span>
	- Prevents binding of pathogens to mucous membranes of host cells

# Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
---
- Definition: an immune response in which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fc receptor-bearing immune effector cells (e.g., NK cells, [[USMLE/Immunology/Eosinophils\|eosinophils]]) bind to and lyse target cells that have specific antibodies attached to their surface antigens (pathogen or tumor-derived)</span>
- Characteristics
	- Allows innate immune cells to recognize pathogens that do not express pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
	- Part of the immune response to parasites
- Effector cells
	- NK cells (most common): interact with IgG-coated target cells and subsequently release cytotoxic substances (perforins, granzymes) 
	- [[USMLE/Immunology/Eosinophils\|Eosinophils]]: interact with IgE-coated helminths and subsequently release major basic proteins and other cytotoxic substances
	- Other: monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils
- Mechanism![paste-201824808206876.jpg](/img/user/appendix/paste-201824808206876.jpg)
	- Binding of antibodies (e.g., IgG or IgE) produced by B-cells to antigens on target cells (e.g., tumor cells, viruses, or parasites)
	- Recognition and binding of the Fc portion of bound IgG or IgE by Fc receptors expressed on the surface of effector cells (e.g., CD16 Fc receptors on NK cells) 
	- Activation of signaling pathways in the effector cell (e.g., NK cell), leading to cytotoxic granule release
	- Destruction of the target cell (e.g., via the perforin/granzyme cell death pathway)
