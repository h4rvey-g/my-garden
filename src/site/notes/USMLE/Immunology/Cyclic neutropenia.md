- **Patho/Etiology**
    - Rare hematologic disorder characterized by periodic oscillations in neutrophil production.
    - **[[USMLE/Biochemistry/Autosomal dominant diseases\|Autosomal dominant]]** mutation in the **`ELANE` gene**, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">which codes for neutrophil elastase. This mutation leads to increased apoptosis of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow.</span>
    - Results in predictable cycles of [[USMLE/Blood/Neutropenia\|neutropenia]], typically occurring **every 21 days** (range 14-36) and lasting for 3-6 days.![Pasted image 20250712212241.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250712212241.png)

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - Usually presents in infancy or early childhood.
    - Patients are asymptomatic between episodes. During neutropenic periods, they experience:
        - Recurrent **fever** and malaise.
        - **Oral manifestations:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aphthous ulcers</span> (mouth sores), gingivitis, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Acute tonsillitis and pharyngitis\|pharyngitis]].
        - **Infections:** Recurrent skin infections (cellulitis), [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]], and [[USMLE/Pathology/Lymphadenopathy\|lymphadenopathy]].
        - Severe infections like [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]] or [[USMLE/Infective disease/Sepsis\|sepsis]] can occur.

- **Diagnosis**
    - **Key diagnostic step:** Serial CBC with differential count **2-3 times per week for 6-8 weeks**.
    - This documents the cyclical pattern of [[USMLE/Blood/Neutropenia\|neutropenia]], with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) dropping to **< 500/µL** (often < 200/µL) during nadirs, followed by recovery to normal or near-normal levels.
    - **Genetic testing** for `ELANE` gene mutation confirms the diagnosis.
    - Bone marrow biopsy during a neutropenic episode shows myeloid [[USMLE/Pathology/Cellular adaptations\|hypoplasia]] or maturational arrest at the myelocyte stage.

- **DDx (Differential Diagnosis)**
    - **Severe Congenital [[USMLE/Blood/Neutropenia\|Neutropenia]] (SCN):** Also caused by `ELANE` mutations, but [[USMLE/Blood/Neutropenia\|neutropenia]] is persistent and severe, not cyclical. SCN carries a higher risk of transformation to AML/MDS.
    - **Autoimmune Neutropenia:** Can be associated with other autoimmune conditions (e.g., SLE, Felty syndrome); diagnosed by anti-neutrophil antibodies.
    - **Drug-induced Neutropenia:** Onset is related to a new medication; resolves after discontinuation.
    - **Viral Infections:** (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Infectious mononucleosis\|EBV]], [[USMLE/Infective disease/Parvovirus B19\|Parvovirus B19]]) can cause transient neutropenia.

- **Management/Treatment**
    - **First-line:** Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (**G-CSF**, e.g., filgrastim).
        - G-CSF shortens the duration and lessens the severity of neutropenic episodes, reducing the frequency of infections.
    - **Infections:** Prompt treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics for febrile neutropenia.
    - **Supportive care:** Good oral hygiene is crucial to manage gingivitis and mouth sores.
    - **Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)** is rarely needed but can be considered for severe cases unresponsive to G-CSF.

- **Key Associations/Complications**
    - **Complications:** Severe bacterial infections (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, necrotizing enterocolitis) are the main risk, especially during neutropenic nadirs.
    - Unlike SCN, cyclic neutropenia **does not** typically carry an increased risk of developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
    - Symptoms may become milder after puberty.
