# General physiology
## Target: histamine H1 receptors
- Location of H1 receptors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Smooth muscles (especially bronchial and nasopharyngeal lining)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vascular endothelial cell surfaces</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Central nervous system</span>
- Histamine effects on H1 receptors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Capillary dilation and permeability</span> → hypotension and edema
	- ↑ Bronchiolar smooth muscle contraction (via IP3 and DAG release) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bronchoconstriction</span>
	- ↑ Nasal and bronchial mucus production
## Target: histamine H2 receptors
- Location of H2 receptors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastric parietal cells (oxyntic cells)</span>
- Histamine effects on H2 receptors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased gastric acid secretion</span>

# H1 antihistamines
## First-generation antihistamines
*   **Mechanism of Action:** Reversible inhibitors of H1 histamine receptors. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They are lipophilic and readily cross the BBB. They also block muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, and serotonergic receptors.</span>
*   **Examples:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diphenhydramine</span>, Dimenhydrinate, Chlorpheniramine, Hydroxyzine, Meclizine, Doxylamine, Promethazine.
*   **Clinical Presentation/Uses:**
    *   **Allergic Conditions:** Allergic rhinitis, urticaria (hives).
    *   **Motion Sickness/Vertigo:** Due to anti-muscarinic effects (e.g., Meclizine, Dimenhydrinate).
    *   **Insomnia:** Due to sedative properties (e.g., Diphenhydramine, Doxylamine).
    *   **Nausea/Vomiting:** Especially in pregnancy (Doxylamine).
*   **Key Associations/Complications (Side Effects):**
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Sedation/Drowsiness:** Due to central H1 receptor blockade. This is a defining and frequently tested side effect.</span>
    *   **Anticholinergic (Antimuscarinic) Effects:** Dry mouth, blurry vision, urinary retention, constipation, confusion. This is especially problematic in the elderly (on Beers list).
    *   **Anti-alpha-1 Adrenergic Effects:** Can lead to orthostatic hypotension and dizziness.
*   **Buzzwords:** "Lipophilic," "crosses BBB," "sedating," "anticholinergic side effects." Avoid in the elderly due to increased risk of delirium and falls.
## Second-generation antihistamines
*   **Mechanism of Action:** Reversible inhibitors of peripheral H1 histamine receptors. They are less lipophilic and do not readily cross the BBB, resulting in fewer CNS side effects.
*   **Examples:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loratadine (rat), Fexofenadine (fox), Cetirizine (satan)</span>, Desloratadine.![Pasted image 20240404091719.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240404091719.png)
*   **Clinical Presentation/Uses:**
    *   **Allergic Conditions:** Preferred for long-term management of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria due to a better side-effect profile.
*   **Key Associations/Complications (Side Effects):**
    *   **Minimal to no sedation:** Fexofenadine is the least sedating, while Cetirizine can be mildly sedating in some individuals.
    *   Far fewer anticholinergic and anti-alpha-adrenergic effects compared to the first generation.
*   **Buzzwords:** "Lipophobic," "non-sedating," "peripheral H1 blockade."

# H2 antihistamines
*   **Note:** While also called "antihistamines," H2 blockers are distinct and primarily used for GI conditions.
*   **Mechanism:** Competitively block H2 receptors on gastric parietal cells, leading to decreased gastric acid secretion.
*   **Examples:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cimetidine</span>, Famotidine, Nizatidine.
*   **Uses:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peptic ulcer disease</span>, GERD, gastritis.
*   **High-Yield Side Effect:** Cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of CYP450 and can cause antiandrogenic effects (gynecomastia, impotence) and cross the BBB to cause confusion.
# Special Use Case: Cyproheptadine

*   A first-generation antihistamine with potent anti-serotonergic (5-HT2A antagonist) properties.
*   **Primary Use:** Used as an antidote for **Serotonin Syndrome**. Serotonin syndrome presents with a triad of autonomic instability, altered mental status, and neuromuscular hyperactivity (e.g., clonus, hyperreflexia).
