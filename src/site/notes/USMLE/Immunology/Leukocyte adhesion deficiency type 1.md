- Definition: A genetic condition characterized by a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">defect in the leukocytic chemotaxis that results in decreased phagocyte activity</span>
- Etiology
	- Autosomal recessive inheritance
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absence of the Î²2-integrin leukocyte adhesion surface molecule LFA-1 (CD18) prevents leukocytes from migrating to tissues during infection or inflammation.</span>

>[!Mnemonic] 
><font color="#ffc000">CD18</font> for leukocyte adhesion deficiency (<font color="#ffc000">LAD</font>) type 1, because once you turn <font color="#ffc000">18</font> you're no longer a <font color="#ffc000">lad</font>.

- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recurrent nonsuppurative bacterial infections</span> (e.g., skin and mucosal infections) with minimal inflammation due to dysfunctional neutrophils
	- Impaired [[USMLE/Pathology/Wound healing\|wound healing]] 
	- Omphalitis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Delayed separation of the umbilical cord (> 30 days postpartum)</span>
		- The normal separation of the umbilical cord is a process that involves inflammation and subsequent healing. 
- Diagnosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Leukocytosis; however, neutrophils are absent at the site of infection</span>
	- Flow cytometry: absent CD18, CD11a, CD11b, and CD11c
