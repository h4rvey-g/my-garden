- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common primary immunodeficiency</span> that is characterized by a near or total absence of serum and secretory IgA
- Pathophysiology: because of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">deficiency of secretory IgA, infections can happen in respiratory tract and GI tract.</span>
- Clinical features
	- Often asymptomatic
	- May manifest with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]] or respiratory infections (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae)</span>, seen in childhood
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]], partially due to elevated susceptibility to parasitic infection (e.g. by Giardia lamblia)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with autoimmune diseases</span> (e.g., [[USMLE/GI/Celiac disease\|gluten-sensitive enteropathy]], inflammatory bowel disease, [[USMLE/Blood/Immune thrombocytopenia\|immune thrombocytopenia]]) and [[USMLE/Respiratory/Atopy\|atopy]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anaphylactic reaction to products containing IgA (e.g., intravenous immunoglobulin)</span>

>[!tip] 
>To prevent [[USMLE/Blood/Transfusion reactions\|transfusion reactions]], IgA-deficient patients must be given washed blood products without IgA or obtain blood from an IgA-deficient donor.
- Diagnosis
	- Decreased serum IgA levels (< 7 mg/dL)
	- Normal IgG and IgM levels
	- False-positive pregnancy tests
