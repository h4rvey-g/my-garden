## Red pulp
Red pulp is composed of splenic cords and sinuses (sinusoids). 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Splenic cords: a reticular meshwork filled with blood (open circulation system) that filters the blood from damaged erythrocytes</span>
- Spleen sinusoids: long vessels with a fenestrated ring-like (“barrel hoop”) basement membrane that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevent old or malformed RBCs/platelets from reentering venous circulation</span>
	- Open circulation: Blood empties from sheathed capillaries into the splenic cords and then enters the sinusoids through slits in the vessel wall.
	- Closed circulation: Blood empties from sheathed capillaries of the red pulp directly into the sinusoids.![Pasted image 20241104104700.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241104104700.png)
- Macrophages: found in the cords and around the sinusoids
	- Phagocytosis of damaged RBCs/platelets that do not reenter circulation 
	- Capture of viruses and opsonized pathogens that enter the red pulp
- Blood flow: splenic artery → arterioles → red pulp (cords → sinusoids) → venules → splenic vein → portal circulation
## White pulp
- Periarteriolar lymphatic sheath
	- Surrounds the arterioles
	- Dense lymphoid tissue containing T lymphocytes
- Splenic follicles
	- Main component of white pulp
	- Close to periarteriolar lymphatic sheath
	- Contain B lymphocytes
- Splenic marginal zone
	- Located between the red pulp and white pulp
	- Contains antigen-presenting cells (APCs): macrophages and specialized B cells (marginal zone B cells)

# Spleen Manifestations in Disease
The spleen's primary roles are filtering blood and mounting immune responses. Its dysfunction or enlargement is a key sign of various systemic diseases. Spleen manifestations can be broadly categorized into **Splenomegaly** (enlargement) and **Hyposplenism/Asplenia** (decreased or absent function).

## Splenomegaly (Enlarged Spleen)

Enlargement occurs via three main mechanisms:
1.  **Congestion:** Due to backup of blood.
2.  **Infiltration:** By abnormal cells (e.g., cancer, lipid-laden macrophages).
3.  **Work Hypertrophy/Hyperplasia:** Increased filtering or immune activity.

**Clinical Presentation:**
*   Often asymptomatic; may present with early satiety, abdominal fullness, or LUQ pain.
*   Palpable spleen below the left costal margin (a normal spleen is usually not palpable).

**Key Causes & Associations:**

*   **Congestive Splenomegaly:**
    *   **Portal Hypertension:** **Most common cause.** Cirrhosis, portal/splenic vein thrombosis.
    *   **Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):** Right-sided heart failure leads to systemic venous congestion.

*   **Hematologic Disorders:**
    *   **Hemolytic Anemias:** Hereditary spherocytosis, Sickle Cell Disease (in children, before autosplenectomy), Thalassemia major, Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. The spleen enlarges as it removes defective RBCs.
    *   **Myeloproliferative Neoplasms:** CML, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis. Often cause **massive splenomegaly** (>1000g or >8 cm below costal margin).
    *   **Leukemias/Lymphomas:** Hairy cell leukemia (massive), CLL, Hodgkin & Non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

*   **Infections:**
    *   **Infectious Mononucleosis (EBV):** Splenomegaly is common; risk of spontaneous rupture with minor trauma.
    *   **Malaria & Leishmaniasis (Kala-azar):** Classic causes of massive splenomegaly.
    *   **Bacterial:** Endocarditis, tuberculosis.

*   **Infiltrative/Storage Diseases:**
    *   **Gaucher Disease:** Classic lysosomal storage disease causing massive splenomegaly due to accumulation of glucocerebrosides in macrophages ("Gaucher cells").
    *   **Niemann-Pick Disease:** Accumulation of sphingomyelin.
    *   **Sarcoidosis & Amyloidosis:** Infiltration by granulomas or amyloid protein, respectively.

## Hyposplenism & Asplenia

This refers to decreased or absent splenic function, leading to impaired blood filtering and immune response.

**Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
*   **Splenectomy:** Surgical removal (e.g., for trauma, ITP, hereditary spherocytosis).
*   **Autosplenectomy:** Repetitive infarction and fibrosis, classically seen in **Sickle Cell Disease** in adults.
*   **Congenital Asplenia:** Rare developmental failure.
*   **Functional Hyposplenism:** Spleen is present but dysfunctional (e.g., celiac disease, SLE, inflammatory bowel disease).

**Diagnosis (Hallmark Peripheral Smear Findings):**
*   **Howell-Jolly bodies:** Basophilic nuclear remnants in RBCs (normally removed by spleen). Their presence is a key sign of hyposplenism.
*   **Target cells (Codocytes):** Due to altered RBC membrane.
*   **Thrombocytosis:** Loss of splenic sequestration of platelets.
*   **Acanthocytes (Spur cells):** Spiky RBCs.

**Complications & Management:**
*   **Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection (OPSI):** High risk of fulminant sepsis from **encapsulated organisms** due to loss of opsonizing IgM production and phagocytosis.
    *   **Key Pathogens:** ***Streptococcus pneumoniae*** (most common), *Haemophilus influenzae* type b, *Neisseria meningitidis*.
    *   Mnemonic: **SHiN**
*   **Prevention:**
    *   **Vaccinations:** Administer vaccines against pneumococcus, meningococcus, and *H. influenzae* type b, ideally before elective splenectomy or as soon as possible after.
    *   **Prophylactic Antibiotics:** Often prescribed, especially for children and the immunocompromised (e.g., penicillin).
    *   **Patient Education:** Advise patients to seek immediate medical care for fevers.
