# Epidemiology
- Commonly located within the internal acoustic canal and can extend into the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cerebellopontine angle</span> (most common tumor of the cerebellopontine angle)![Pasted image 20240307215055.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240307215055.png)

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- Early symptoms: as a result of tumor expansion into the internal acoustic canal (internal auditory meatus), causing pressure on the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII)
	- Cochlear nerve involvement
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unilateral sensorineural [[USMLE/Neurology/Hearing loss\|hearing loss]] (most common symptom)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tinnitus</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vestibular nerve involvement</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dizziness</span>
- Late symptoms: caused by pressure of adjacent structures within the cerebellopontine angle
	- Trigeminal nerve (CN V) involvement: paresthesia (numbness), hypoesthesia (decreased sensation), and/or unilateral facial pain
	- [[USMLE/Neurology/Facial nerve palsy\|Facial nerve]] (CN VII) involvement: peripheral, unilateral facial weakness that can progress to paralysis 
	- Compression of structures in posterior fossa

# Pathology
![L66367.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L66367.jpg)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spindle cells (fibroblasts) in palisades (Antoni A tissue) alternating with myxoid hypocellular areas (Antoni B tissue)</span>![Pasted image 20240103150456.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240103150456.png)
	- A characteristic finding of neuromas is the simultaneous occurrence of areas with densely packed nuclei (palisade pattern; A) and scattered or anuclear areas (B). There is also a large number of vacuolated cells (C).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">S-100 positive</span>
	- S-100 can be seen in [[USMLE/MSK/Melanoma\|melanoma]], schwannoma, [[USMLE/MSK/Langerhans cell histiocytosis\|Langerhans cell histiocytosis]]
