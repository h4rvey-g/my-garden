- Topical ophthalmic therapy. Administer the following eye drops in succession, one minute apart: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct parasympathomimetic: pilocarpine </span>
	- Alpha-2 agonist: apraclonidine
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|Beta blocker]]: timolol 
- PLUS a systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
	- Acetazolamide 

>[!tip] [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Parasympathomimetic drugs\|Cholinomimetic drugs]] include
>- Cholinergic Receptor Agonists: Can directly stimulate cholinergic receptors.
>- Anti-Cholinesterase Drugs: Inhibit the hydrolysis of acetylcholine (ACh), increasing the concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft.
>- Acetylcholine Release Promoters: Increase the release of ACh from nerve terminals.

## Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment: normal appearing anterior chamber angle</span>
- Tonometry
	- To measure IOP (standard values range between 10â€“21 mm Hg)
- Gonioscopy: to rule out angle-closure glaucoma
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fundoscopy: cupping and pallor of [[USMLE/Neurology/Eye and orbit\|optic disc]]</span>, disc hemorrhage, diffuse or focal narrowing of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Eye and orbit\|optic disc]] rim
	- "Cupping" refers to the enlargement or deepening of this central optic cup relative to the overall size of the optic disc.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Optic nerve fibers are outside of optic cup in the optic disk. So when nerve fibers are ischemic and lost, the optic cup increases in size.</span>![Pasted image 20240311165723.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240311165723.png)![Pasted image 20240311165743.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240311165743.png)
## Treatment of open-angle glaucoma
Topical prostaglandins are most effective and usually used initially; other drugs (with a different mechanism) may be added if topical prostaglandins are unsuccessful.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Preferred first-line therapy: topical [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Prostaglandin vs Prostacyclin\|prostaglandin]] analogs </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Latanoprost</span>
