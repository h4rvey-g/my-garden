# Etiology
---
- Primary source of infection
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contiguous spread of an infection (most common cause)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Can be otogenic (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Acute otitis media\|otitis media]], mastoiditis)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sinus (e.g., [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]]): most commonly seen in men and caused by Streptococcus milleri</span>
		- Oral (e.g., dental infection)
		- Meningeal (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]])
	- Direct injection, e.g., head trauma, neurosurgery
	- Hematogenous spread, e.g., patients with cyanotic heart disease (least common cause): multiple abscesses located in the middle cerebral artery distribution at the gray-white junction
- Pathogens: brain abscesses are most commonly polymicrobial
	- Most common pathogens
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Viridans streptococci (often secondary to [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]])</span>
		- [[USMLE/Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus\|Staphylococcus aureus]]
		- Less common pathogens
	- Obligate anaerobes, e.g., Bacteroides species, (mainly due to dental infections)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In immunocompromised states: Toxoplasma</span>, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Aspergillosis\|Aspergillus]], Candida, Mucormycosis (also known as Zygomycosis), Cryptococcus
