# Epidemiology

# Etiology
- Pathogen: herpes simplex virus
	- Neonates: both [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-1 and [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-2
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalitis may especially occur with HSV-2 infection in neonates or immunocompromised patients (e.g., with HIV-AIDS)</span>, which can affect the insular cortex, brain stem, and cingulate gyri. HSV-2 primarily causes a benign course of viral [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]] in immunocompetent adults.
	- Adult: usually [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-1
		- HSV-1 predominately affects the medial temporal lobes with or without inferolateral frontal lobe involvement. 

>[!tip] 
>HSV encephalitis is mainly caused by HSV-1, whereas HSV [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]] is typically caused by HSV-2.

# Clinical features
## Prodromal phase
- Duration: a few hours to days
- Nonspecific symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever</span>
		- Differ from [[USMLE/Neurology/Ischemic stroke\|ischemic stroke]]
	- Headache
	- Nausea and vomiting
## Acute or subacute encephalopathy
- Focal neurological deficits <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(primarily affects the medial temporal lobe)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered sense of smell and loss of vision</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Aphasia\|Aphasia]]</span>
	- Memory loss
	- Hemiparesis
	- Ataxia
	- Hyperreflexia
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|Seizures]] (focal or generalized)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Altered mental status (e.g., confusion, disorientation, lowered level of consciousness)</span>
>[!tip] 
>HSE may resemble bacterial [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]], but the combination of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">altered mental status, [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]], and focal neurological deficits</span> is more common for HSE!

# Diagnostics
## [[USMLE/Neurology/Cerebrospinal fluid analysis\|CSF]] studies
- Cell count and differential
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Lymphocytes (lymphocytic pleocytosis)</span>

- Opening pressure
	- Normal or ↑

	- Mild ↑ 
- Glucose
	- Normal
## Neuroimaging
- MRI head
	- Characteristic features include signs of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe edema and/or hemorrhage.</span>
		- T1 sequence: hypointense temporal lobe areas
		- T2/FLAIR sequence: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperintense temporal lobe lesions and signal abnormalities</span>![Pasted image 20250201171222.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250201171222.png)
# Pathology
- Macroscopic: typical <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">temporal lobe distribution with visible necrosis </span>![Pasted image 20240124112737.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240124112737.png)
- Microscopic
	- Hemorrhagic-necrotizing inflammation
	- Eosinophilic nuclear inclusions (Cowdry bodies)

- Fatal in up to 70% of cases if left untreated
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In patients receiving treatment, the mortality rate is still as high as 20–30%.</span>
