- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Quickly developing (within minutes), short, recurring attacks that usually occur in a cyclical pattern (“cluster periods”) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Circadian Rhythm:** Attacks often occur at the **same time each day**, frequently awakening the patient from sleep (especially 1-2 AM).</span>
	- **Circannual Rhythm:** Headaches occur in "clusters" or series lasting weeks to months, followed by remission periods that can last for months or years.
	- Attacks are brief (15-180 minutes) but occur frequently during a cluster period (from once every other day to 8 times a day).
- **Alcohol** is a potent trigger **during a cluster period** but not during remission.
