- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Quickly developing (within minutes), short, recurring attacks that usually occur in a cyclical pattern (“cluster periods”) </span>
	- May become chronic (less common), with interruptions of less than three months between cluster bouts 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Attacks often wake patients up during sleep.</span>
	- This clustering may suggest involvement of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Hypothalamus\|hypothalamus]], which regulates <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">circadian rhythms</span>.
