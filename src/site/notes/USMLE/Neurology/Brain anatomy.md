# Meninges and spaces
---
## 1. Anatomical Relationships and Size of Spaces

The meninges consist of three layers surrounding the brain and spinal cord:

- **Dura mater** (outermost, tough layer)
- **Arachnoid mater** (middle, web-like layer)
- **Pia mater** (innermost, delicate layer adherent to the brain surface)

Between these layers, there are spaces:

- **Epidural space**: Between the dura mater and the skull (or vertebral bones).
	- In the cranial cavity, this space is a **potential space** because the dura is tightly adherent to the skull. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Has Middle Meningeal Artery.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In the spinal canal, the epidural space is a **real space** containing fat and venous plexuses.</span>
	- Thickness: In the spinal canal, approx. 1-3 mm, variable by location.

- **Subdural space**: Between dura mater and arachnoid mater.
	- This is a **potential space**; normally the arachnoid and dura are in close contact. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Has Bridging Veins.</span>
	- Thickness: Minimal under normal conditions, expands pathologically if bleeding occurs (subdural hematoma).

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Subarachnoid space**</span>: Between arachnoid mater and pia mater.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This is a **real space** filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), trabeculae, and blood vessels.</span>
	- Thickness: Variable depending on location; generally about 1-5 mm.
	- This space extends around the brain and [[USMLE/Neurology/Neuroloy physioloy\|spinal cord]].

## 2. Functions of Each Layer and Their Spaces

- **Dura Mater**
	- Function: Provides a tough protective outer covering; dural septa compartmentalize brain regions (falx cerebri, tentorium cerebelli).
	- In [[USMLE/Neurology/Neuroloy physioloy\|spinal cord]], dura mater forms a protective covering and encloses the epidural space.

- **Epidural Space**
	- In the spine: provides cushioning and a route for venous return.
	- Clinical use: Site for [[USMLE/Neurology/Regional anesthesia\|epidural anesthesia]].

- **Arachnoid Mater**
	- Function: Thin, web-like membrane facilitating the passage of blood vessels.
	- Its trabeculae extend to the pia mater.

- **Subdural Space**
	- Normally a potential space; no major function.
	- Clinical: Site where blood can accumulate during traumatic injury (subdural hematoma).

- **Subarachnoid Space**
	- Function: Contains CSF, which cushions and nourishes the brain.
	- Its trabeculae suspend the brain within the skull.
	- Contains cerebral arteries and veins.

- **Pia Mater**
	- Delicate membrane tightly adherent to the brain surface.
	- Supports tiny blood vessels entering brain tissue.
	- Participates in blood-brain barrier and nutrient exchange.
## 3. Clinical Relevance

| Space                  | Clinical Points                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Epidural Space**     | - In spinal epidural analgesia/anesthesia<br>- Epidural hematomas (cranial) occurring between dura and skull are arterial and rapid |
| **Subdural Space**     | - Subdural hematomas from bridging vein tearing; venous, slower onset<br>- Potential space expands with blood accumulation          |
| **Subarachnoid Space** | - Site of CSF flow; lumbar puncture accesses this space<br>- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (from ruptured aneurysm) is life-threatening   |

<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CSF flow: CSF production: produced by choroid plexuses in the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles by filtration of plasma → lateral ventricles → third ventricle (via interventricular foramina) → fourth ventricle (via cerebral aqueduct) → diffusion and active transfer into the subarachnoid space (via foramina of Luschka and Magendie) → reabsorption in the arachnoid granulations (a group of projections of the arachnoid mater into the dural sinuses) → drainage into the dural venous sinuses</span> → internal jugular veins, ultimately heart
