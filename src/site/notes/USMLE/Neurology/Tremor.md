- Action Tremor: **Occurs During Voluntary Muscle Movement**
	- This is the classic sign of **cerebellar dysfunction**. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The cerebellum is crucial for error correction and coordinating the timing and force of movements.</span> Damage disrupts this feed-forward control, causing overshooting and corrective "jerks" that manifest as a tremor, which amplifies as the movement requires more precision near the target.
	- Cerebellar Disease (e.g., spinocerebellar ataxia, [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin E\|Vitamin E]] deficiency, stroke, [[USMLE/Neurology/Multiple sclerosis\|multiple sclerosis]], [[USMLE/GI/Wilson disease\|Wilson disease]])
- Resting Tremor: **Occurs at Rest**
	- Primarily due to dysfunction in the **[[USMLE/Neurology/Basal ganglia\|basal ganglia]]**, specifically the substantia nigra, leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">disturbances in the neural circuits that control movement initiation</span>. This is often related to [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|dopamine]] depletion.

	- Midbrain Tremor
	- [[USMLE/GI/Wilson disease\|Wilson Disease]]
	- Progressive supranuclear palsy
	- Multiple System Atrophy
	- Drug-Induced Parkinsonism
- Postural Tremor: **Occurs While Held Motionless Against Gravity**
	- Often linked to dysfunction in the **cerebello-thalamo-cortical network**. The cerebellum helps coordinate and smoothen motor commands, and dysfunction can lead to oscillations when maintaining a steady posture. It can also be an exaggeration of normal physiologic tremor.
