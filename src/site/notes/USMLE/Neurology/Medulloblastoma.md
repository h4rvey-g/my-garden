# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">most common location is the cerebellum → cerebellar defects (e.g., broad-based [[USMLE/Neurology/Gait\|gait]])</span>
- cerebellar vermis (midline) → truncal ataxia
- Invasion or compression of the 4th ventricle → noncommunicating hydrocephalus → features of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., papilledema, vomiting, headache)
- Drop metastases to the spinal cord are common → paraplegia
