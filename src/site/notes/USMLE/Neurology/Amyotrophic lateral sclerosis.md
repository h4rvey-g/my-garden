a neurodegenerative disease with upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction.
# Epidemiology
- Mean age of onset is 65 years.

---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Classically affects the entire motor neuron system at two or more levels (both upper and lower motor neuron degeneration).</span>
	- Upper motor neurons in the precentral gyrus and, frequently, prefrontal cortex
	- Lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Neuroloy physioloy\|spinal cord]] and brainstem
- Pathology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">UMN: degeneration & atrophy of lateral corticospinal tracts, precentral gyrus</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">LMN: degeneration of anterior horn (thin anterior roots) & cranial nerve motor nuclei</span>
	- Muscle: denervation atrophy (angular fibers with crowded nuclei)

## General disease characteristics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Both upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs are present</span> (see [[USMLE/Neurology/Upper motor neuron (UMN) injury vs. lower motor neuron (LMN) injury\|Upper motor neuron (UMN) injury vs. lower motor neuron (LMN) injury]])
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Constant disease progression</span>: it usually starts in one arm and/or leg then progresses to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">contralateral side</span>
## Early symptoms
- Symptoms are highly variable and potentially non-specific (e.g., subtle vocal changes or difficulties grasping objects)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asymmetric limb weakness, often beginning with weakness in the hands and feet </span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bulbar symptoms such as dysarthria, dysphagia, and tongue atrophy (20% of cases at disease onset)</span>
- [[USMLE/Neurology/Bulbar palsy\|Pseudobulbar palsy]] with pseudobulbar affect may develop.
- Fasciculations, cramps, and muscle stiffness
- Weight loss
- Split hand sign: a wasting pattern in which the muscles of the thenar eminence atrophy due to degeneration of the lateral portion of the anterior horn of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Neuroloy physioloy\|spinal cord]]
## Late symptoms
- Cognitive impairment (approx. 15% of ALS patients meet the criteria for [[USMLE/Neurology/Frontotemporal dementia\|frontotemporal dementia]])
- Autonomic symptoms (e.g., constipation, bladder dysfunction) may develop; the mechanism of development is unclear. 
- Life-threatening symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Respiratory failure due to paralysis of respiratory muscles</span>
	- Dysphagia due to bulbar weakness or [[USMLE/Neurology/Bulbar palsy\|pseudobulbar palsy]]

# Diagnosis
- Electromyography
	- Denervation: fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and large amplitudes
	- Fasciculations
# Differential Diagnosis
- [[USMLE/MSK/Myasthenia gravis\|Myasthenia gravis]]
	- Weakness improves with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No UMN or LMN signs</span>

---
# Treatment
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Riluzole</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A sodium-channel blocker that inhibits glutamate release in the CNS and decreases glutamate excitotoxicity</span>
	- Prolongs survival and slows functional decline in patients with ALS (on average, for 3 months)
- Edaravone
	- A free radical scavenger 
	- Has been shown to slow functional decline in some patients with ALS
