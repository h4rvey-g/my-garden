# Pathophysiology/Etiology

- **Definition:** Aneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid artery (ICA) segment passing through the cavernous sinus. These are **extradural** and thus have a low risk of [[USMLE/Neurology/Intracranial hemorrhage\|subarachnoid hemorrhage]] ([[USMLE/Neurology/Intracranial hemorrhage\|SAH]]).
- **Pathophysiology:** Symptoms arise from **mass effect** on adjacent structures within the cavernous sinus, not typically from rupture.
- **Etiology:** Often idiopathic. Risk factors include [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|atherosclerosis]], [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypertension\|hypertension]], smoking, female gender, trauma, and infections (mycotic aneurysm).

# Clinical Presentation

- Many are **asymptomatic** and found incidentally.
- **Symptomatic Presentation ([[USMLE/Neurology/Cavernous sinus syndrome\|Cavernous Sinus Syndrome]]):**![Pasted image 20250709171221.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250709171221.png)
    - **Ophthalmoplegia:** Due to compression of cranial nerves (CN).
        - **CN VI (Abducens) Palsy:** Most common finding. Results in lateral rectus weakness and horizontal diplopia.
        - **CN III (Oculomotor) Palsy:** Can cause ptosis and "down and out" eye deviation. May be pupil-sparing initially, as parasympathetic fibers are on the periphery and less susceptible to external compression compared to ischemic injury.
        - **CN IV (Trochlear) Palsy:** Causes vertical diplopia, often noticed when reading or going down stairs.
    - **Sensory Deficits:** Facial pain or numbness in the **V1 (ophthalmic)** and **V2 (maxillary)** distributions due to CN V (Trigeminal) compression.
    - **Horner's Syndrome:** (Ptosis, Miosis, Anhidrosis) from compression of the oculosympathetic fibers that travel with the ICA.
    - **Headache:** Often retro-orbital.

# Diagnosis

- **CTA / MRA:** Excellent non-invasive initial tests. Show an enhancing, well-circumscribed lesion within the cavernous sinus, continuous with the ICA. MRA is superior for delineating soft tissue and any thrombus.
- **Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA):** **Gold standard.** Provides definitive diagnosis, shows precise anatomy of the aneurysm neck, and is critical for planning endovascular treatment.

# DDx

- **Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis:** Typically presents more acutely with signs of infection (fever, sepsis), proptosis, and chemosis, often from a facial or sinus infection.
- **Meningioma:** A solid, dural-based tumor that enhances avidly and uniformly on contrast imaging. May show a "dural tail."
- **Tolosa-Hunt Syndrome:** Idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus causing painful ophthalmoplegia. Diagnosis of exclusion, shows dramatic improvement with steroids.
- **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula (CCF):** Abnormal connection between the ICA and cavernous sinus. Presents with the classic triad of **pulsatile exophthalmos, ocular bruit, and chemosis**. Often post-traumatic.

# Management/Treatment

- **Asymptomatic/Small Aneurysms:** Conservative management with serial imaging (e.g., MRA) to monitor for growth.
- **Symptomatic/Large/Growing Aneurysms:**
    - **Endovascular Therapy (First-Line):**
        - **Flow-Diverting Stent:** A stent placed across the aneurysm neck to promote thrombosis within the aneurysm while maintaining flow in the parent vessel.
        - **Coil Embolization:** Packing the aneurysm sac with platinum coils to induce thrombosis. May be combined with stenting.
    - **Parent Artery Occlusion:** Therapeutic occlusion of the ICA, considered if collateral circulation is adequate (assessed by balloon test occlusion).
    - **Microsurgical Clipping:** Rarely performed due to the high morbidity associated with operating within the cavernous sinus.

# Key Associations/Complications

- **Cavernous Sinus Syndrome:** The primary clinical manifestation.
- **Carotid-Cavernous Fistula (CCF):** Can occur if the aneurysm ruptures into the surrounding venous sinus.
- **Thromboembolism:** Clot from within the aneurysm can embolize distally, causing a TIA or stroke.
- **Epistaxis:** Rare but life-threatening complication if the aneurysm erodes through the sphenoid bone into the sphenoid sinus.
