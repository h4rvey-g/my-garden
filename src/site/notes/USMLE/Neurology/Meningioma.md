Meningiomas are a diverse group of [[USMLE/Neurology/Brain tumors\|brain tumors]] that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">arise from the arachnoid layer</span> (specifically the arachnoid cap cells) and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">can therefore occur in any part of the CNS with a meningeal covering.</span>
# Epidemiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common benign primary [[USMLE/Neurology/Brain tumors\|brain tumor]] in adults</span>

# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple meningiomas may develop in patients with [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurocutaneous disorders\|neurofibromatosis]] type II.</span>

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mostly asymptomatic </span>
	- Meningiomas are slow-growing tumors and, as such, they are less invasive and the body has more time to adapt to the tumor.
- General symptoms of CNS tumors (e.g., [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]] and focal neurologic signs)

# Diagnostics
---
## MRI (imaging modality of choice)
- Plain MRI findings 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Round, sharply demarcated space-occupying lesion</span> with radiological features of an extra-axial tumor
	- Dural tail sign  
	- T1: isointense or hypointense 
	- T2: isointense or hyperintense
- Contrast MRI findings 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Significant homogenous enhancement of the meningioma</span>![Pasted image 20250209204950.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250209204950.png)
		- As meningiomas grow, they often stimulate angiogenesis

# Pathology
---
## Microscopic findings
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mesenchymal origin (arachnoid cap cells)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Whorls of meningothelial cells (onion peel arrangement)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Pathology/Psammoma body\|Psammoma bodies]]</span>![Pasted image 20231224160212.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231224160212.png)![L2092.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L2092.jpg)Two of these whorls have a deeply basophilic acellular core, known as a [[USMLE/Pathology/Psammoma body\|psammoma body]], which indicates dystrophic calcification.
