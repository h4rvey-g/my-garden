# Epidemiology
---
- Second most common type of dementia (15–20% of cases) 
- Prevalence increases with age (∼ 1–4% in patients ≥ 65 years).

# Etiology
---
- VD may occur as a result of a prolonged and severe cerebral ischemia of any etiology, primarily: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large artery occlusion (usually cortical ischemia)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lacunar stroke (small vessel occlusion resulting in subcortical ischemia)</span>
	- Chronic subcortical ischemia

# Pathophysiology
---
![L86625.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L86625.jpg)
- Large-vessel [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|atherosclerosis]]
- Small-vessel disease (eg, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Atherosclerosis\|arteriolosclerosis]])
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

# Clinical features
---
- Multi-infarct: often with stepwise decline
- Strategic infarct: associated with localizing cortical deficits
	- These infarcts are termed "strategic" because they affect regions that play a crucial role in certain brain functions.
- Subcortical vascular encephalopathy: associated with subcortical signs (eg, [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary incontinence\|urinary incontinence]], [[USMLE/Neurology/Gait\|gait]] disturbances)

>[!tip] vs [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Alzheimer disease\|Alzheimer disease]]
>The most significant symptoms of vascular dementia tend to involve speed of thinking and problem-solving rather than memory loss.
