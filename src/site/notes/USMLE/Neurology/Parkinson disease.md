# Etiology

## Parkinson disease
- Idiopathic
- Contributing genetic factors include:
	- α-Synuclein (SNCA)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">α-Synuclein constitutes the major component of Lewy bodies.</span> In addition to mutations, duplication/triplication of the wild-type gene can also cause PD (due to increased production of the normal protein).

- Progressive dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra (part of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Basal ganglia\|basal ganglia]]) and the locus coeruleus → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|dopamine]] deficiency at the respective receptors of the striatum with interrupted transmission to the thalamus and motor cortex → motor symptoms of PD</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|Serotonin]] and noradrenaline depletion (in the raphe nuclei): likely cause of depressive symptoms</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|Acetylcholine]] surplus (in the nucleus basalis of Meynert): likely cause of dyskinesia</span>

# Clinical features
---
## Motor signs
- Parkinsonism
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bradykinesia</span>: slowed movements in combination with decreased amplitude/speed when moving 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Tremor\|Resting tremor]]</span> (4–6 Hz)
		- Oftentimes the presenting symptom
		- Pill-rolling tremor that subsides with voluntary movements but increases with stress
	- [[USMLE/MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity\|Rigidity]]: increased and persistent resistance to passive joint movement that is independent of speed
		- Cogwheel rigidity
- Postural instability 
	- Imbalance and tendency to fall
- Parkinsonian gait: shuffling gait with quickened and shortened steps

# Diagnostics
---
## Pathology
- Lewy bodies
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Aggregates of misfolded α-synuclein and other proteins</span>, such as ubiquitin and neurofilament protein within the neural cell bodies
	- Appear histologically as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intracellular hyaline eosinophilic globules</span>
	- May be found in brainstem, substantia nigra, and cortex
	- Also seen in Lewy body [[USMLE/Neurology/Dementia\|dementia]]

- Image A: An eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion (Lewy body; blue overlay) is visible inside a neuron. There is a large accumulation of neuromelanin (brown granules; green overlay).
- Image B: A neurite staining positive for α-synuclein is visible in the center of the image (Lewy neurite; yellow overlay).

![Pasted image 20240727153218.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240727153218.png)
## Nonergot [[USMLE/Neurology/Neurotransmitters\|dopamine]] receptor agonists
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pramipexole</span>, Ropinirole, Apomorphine
- Consider as initial treatment in younger patients, especially those with risk factors for levodopa-induced dyskinesia.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Some patients develop impulse control disorders with compulsive gambling or hypersexuality.</span>
>[!tip] 
>- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ergot dopamine agonists (cabergoline and bromocriptine)</span> are not recommended in Parkinson disease or restless leg syndrome, but are<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> first-line treatment in [[USMLE/Endocrine/Pituitary adenoma\|Prolactinoma]] and [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia\|Hyperprolactinemia]].</span>
>	- Primarily due to a higher risk of serious side effects, specifically fibrotic reactions affecting the heart valves and lungs.
>	- The **doses used for [[USMLE/Endocrine/Pituitary adenoma\|Prolactinoma]] and [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperprolactinemia\|Hyperprolactinemia]] are generally lower** than for Parkinson's, leading to a **lower risk of fibrotic side effects**, making the benefit-risk balance more favorable.
## Anticholinergic drugs ([[USMLE/Pharmacology/Muscarinic antagonists\|muscarinic antagonists]])
- Benztropine, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Trihexyphenidyl</span>, Biperiden
- Beneficial regarding tremor and rigidity but does not improve bradykinesia
## Deep brain stimulation (DBS)
- In PD, the lack of dopamine leads to **overactivity** in the _indirect pathway_. Key players here are the **STN** and the **GPi**.
- Indications
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Severe motor symptoms or refractory tremor</span>
	- Decrease in dosage of medication because of adverse effects
- Procedure
	- Stereotactic implantation of stimulating electrode(s) <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">targeting the subthalamic nucleus or internal globus pallidus</span>
	- Controlled remotely

# Parkinson-plus syndromes
## [[USMLE/Neurology/Dementia\|Dementia]] with Lewy bodies
- Epidemiology
	- Second most common form of neurodegenerative [[USMLE/Neurology/Dementia\|dementia]] (10–20% of [[USMLE/Neurology/Dementia\|dementia]] cases) 
- Diagnosis requires two of the following
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cognitive fluctuations</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visual hallucinations</span>
