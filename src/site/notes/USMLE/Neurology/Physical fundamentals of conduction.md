- Axon conduction speed depends on two constants: the length constant (λ) and the time constant (τ).
    
    - Relationship: Velocity ≈ λ / τ (as suggested by "velocity = length/time", linking these constants).
- **Length Constant (λ):**
    
    - **Definition:** A measure of how far along an axon an electrical impulse can propagate passively (without active regeneration by ion channels).![Pasted image 20250506102541.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250506102541.png)
    - **Basis:** Determined by the relative resistance of conduction along the axon (intracellular, Ri) compared to the resistance across the membrane (membrane, Rm). It's related to √(Rm/Ri).
    - **Myelin's Effect:** _Increases_ the length constant.
        - Mechanism: Primarily by _increasing_ membrane resistance (Rm), which reduces charge leak/dissipation across the membrane in the myelinated internodes.
        - Benefit: Allows the depolarization from one Node of Ranvier to spread farther down the axon to activate the next Node of Ranvier efficiently.
    - **Demyelination's Effect:** _Decreases_ the length constant.
        - Result: Shorter impulse conduction distance, making it harder to reach the threshold at the subsequent node.
- **Time Constant (τ):**
    
    - **Definition:** A measure of the time it takes for the membrane potential to change in response to a change in membrane current or permeability (e.g., Na+ channel activation).![Pasted image 20250506102729.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250506102729.png)
    - **Basis:** Determined by membrane resistance (Rm) and membrane capacitance (Cm). Formula: τ = Rm * Cm.
    - **Myelin's Effect (in internodes):** _Decreases_ the time constant.
        - Mechanism:
            - _Increases_ membrane resistance (Rm).
            - _Decreases_ membrane capacitance (Cm) - myelin acts as an insulator separating charge farther across the membrane, reducing its ability to store charge in response to voltage change.
        - Benefit: Allows the membrane potential to change faster, speeding up the depolarization process at the nodes.
    - **Demyelination's Effect:** _Increases_ the time constant.
        - Result: Slower changes in membrane voltage, slowing down the depolarization at affected regions.
