# Epidemiology
---
- Most common motor disability in children

# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---
Spastic cerebral palsy may be caused by white matter necrosis (seen in this patient as periventricular leukomalacia), which leads to a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of descending inhibitory control</span> from the upper motor neurons.  This results in muscle overactivity, leading to increased tone and hyperreflexia.

# Clinical features
---
- All types 
	- Intellectual disability (50%) 
	- Seizure disorder (35%–50%)
	- Upper motor neuron signs (e.g., [[USMLE/MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity\|spasticity]], hyperreflexia, [[USMLE/MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity\|clonus]])
	- Behavioral difficulties
	- Developmental delay, particularly motor function (e.g., rolling over from back to belly, sitting independently, crawling).
	- [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spastic type</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Muscle tone in one or more limbs </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Deep tendon reflexes</span>
		- Persistence of primitive reflexes (e.g., positive Babinski sign) 

>[!warning] 
>Definite hand preference before 1 year of age suggests <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">one-sided muscle weakness</span> and is a red flag for hemiplegia.

# Diagnostics

# Treatment
---
- Pharmacological management
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antispasmodics</span> (e.g., botulinum toxin, baclofen, dantrolene, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Psychiatry/Sedative-hypnotic drugs\|benzodiazepines]]</span>)
	- [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|Anticonvulsants]]
	- Anticholinergics for rigidity and sialorrhea
