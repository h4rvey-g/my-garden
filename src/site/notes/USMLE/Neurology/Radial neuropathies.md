# Etiology

- Risk factors vary according to the location of the injury:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Axilla: improper crutch use (crutch palsy)</span>
	- Mid-arm:
		- Fracture of humerus (radial nerve runs in spiral groove)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Compression of the radial nerve due to draping of arm over furniture (saturday night palsy)</span> or pressure on the axilla or upper medial arm; more likely in the setting of intoxication, anesthesia, or sleep (honeymoon palsy)
	- Elbow: radial tunnel syndrome (controversial diagnosis ) due to chronic compression within the radial tunnel
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Deep forearm: posterior interosseous nerve syndrome (a syndrome characterized by weakness of muscles in the extensor compartment of the forearm) due to fracture of the radial head or chronic soft tissue compression</span>
