# Epidemiology
---
Predominantly affects <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obese women aged 15–44 years</span>

# Etiology
---
- Risk factors 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Female sex</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Obesity and metabolic syndrome\|Obesity]]</span>
	- Certain medications (drug-induced intracranial hypertension), including:
		- Growth hormone
		- [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tetracyclines\|Tetracyclines]]
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Excessive [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin A\|vitamin A]] or derivatives </span>
		- Danazol

# Pathophysiology
---
- A mismatch between production and resorption of CSF (cause unknown) → ↑ ICP → damage to structures of the CNS and especially to the optical nerve fibers
- Orthograde axoplasmic flow stasis at the optic nerve head leads to bilateral papilledema.

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffuse headaches</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visual symptoms</span>
	- Transient vision loss 
- Pulsatile tinnitus (swishing sound)
- Cranial nerve disorders (especially CN VI → diplopia)
- No cognitive impairment
# Diagnostics
---
- Ophthalmologic examination
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ophthalmoscopy: bilateral papilledema</span> 
	- Visual field test may show an enlarged blind spot and peripheral loss of vision
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal CT scan of head</span>
- MRI: with contrast and MR venography (MRV) 
	- To rule out other causes of increased ICP
	- Shows
		- Unremarkable brain parenchyma
- Lumbar puncture (LP)
	- Elevated opening pressure > 20 cm H2O
