# 1. Normal Aging

*   **Cognitive Changes**: Mild decline in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">processing speed</span> and difficulty with multitasking or word-finding ("tip of the tongue"). <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Memory lapses are occasional and do not disrupt daily life (e.g., misplacing keys).</span>
*   **Functional Impact**: **No interference** with activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental ADLs (IADLs). Patient remains independent.
*   **Key Differentiator**: Subjective complaints <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">without objective, significant decline on cognitive testing</span>. Function is preserved.

# 2. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MCI)

*   **Cognitive Changes**: Evidence of **modest cognitive decline** in one or more domains (e.g., memory, executive function) that is noticeable to the patient, an informant, or the clinician. More persistent than normal aging.
*   **Functional Impact**: **No significant interference** with independence in IADLs, though tasks may take longer or require compensatory strategies.
*   **Key Differentiator**: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Objective evidence of cognitive decline on testing</span>, but **independence in daily life is preserved**. It represents a transitional state between normal aging and major neurocognitive disorder.

# 3. Major Neurocognitive Disorder (Dementia)

*   **Cognitive Changes**: Evidence of **significant cognitive decline** from a previous level in one or more domains. This is a general term, not a specific disease.
*   **Functional Impact**: Cognitive deficits **interfere with independence** in everyday activities (IADLs like managing finances/medications, and eventually basic ADLs).
*   **Key Differentiator**: Cognitive decline is severe enough to **impair functional independence**.

# 4. Major Depression (Pseudodementia)

*   **Clinical Presentation**: Patient often has a history of depression and complains emphatically about memory loss ("I don't know" answers). Onset is often subacute and can be dated precisely. Associated with classic depressive symptoms (anhedonia, sleep/appetite changes).
*   **Cognitive Profile**: Deficits are often related to poor effort and concentration. Patients appear distressed by their cognitive symptoms.
*   **Key Differentiator**: Cognitive symptoms **improve with treatment of depression**. Patients are more likely to self-report cognitive problems than those with dementia. However, late-life depression is a significant risk factor for developing true dementia later.

# Specific Dementias (Major Neurocognitive Disorders)

## a. Alzheimer Disease (AD)

*   **Patho/Etiology**: Most common cause of dementia. Accumulation of extracellular **amyloid-beta plaques** and intracellular **neurofibrillary tangles** (hyperphosphorylated tau).
*   **Clinical Presentation**: **Gradual, progressive** decline. **Early and prominent memory impairment** (amnestic) is the classic feature, followed by language and visuospatial deficits. Behavioral changes often occur later.
*   **Diagnosis**: Clinical diagnosis. Brain imaging shows diffuse or temporal/parietal lobe atrophy. CSF may show low amyloid-beta 42 and high tau.

## b. Vascular Dementia (VaD)

*   **Patho/Etiology**: Second most common cause. Caused by cerebrovascular disease (e.g., multiple infarcts, small vessel disease).
*   **Clinical Presentation**: **Stepwise decline** in function with periods of stability followed by sudden deterioration. Presentation depends on the location of infarcts; **executive dysfunction** is often more prominent than memory loss early on. Focal neurological deficits may be present.
*   **Diagnosis**: Clinical history supported by neuroimaging (MRI) showing evidence of strokes or significant white matter disease.

## c. Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)

*   **Patho/Etiology**: Degeneration of the frontal and/or temporal lobes. Can be associated with tau protein (Pick bodies) or TDP-43 inclusions.
*   **Clinical Presentation**: Younger age of onset (typically 40s-60s) is a key clue.
    *   **Behavioral variant (bvFTD)**: Early and prominent changes in **personality, behavior, and social conduct** (e.g., disinhibition, apathy, compulsive behavior).
    *   **Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)**: Early and prominent **language deficits** (e.g., word-finding difficulty, impaired grammar).
*   **Key Differentiator from AD**: In early stages, memory and visuospatial skills are relatively preserved compared to the profound behavioral or language changes.
