# Etiology
---
1. **Conductive Hearing Loss (CHL): Affects Outer/Middle Ear**
	- **Cerumen Impaction:** External canal; Common, easily fixed.
	- **Otitis Media:** Middle ear; Fluid/infection, common in kids.
	- **Otosclerosis:** Middle ear (stapes); Bony overgrowth, familial, progressive.
	- **Tympanic Membrane Perforation:** Middle ear (TM); Trauma/infection.
	- **Cholesteatoma:** Middle ear/mastoid; Destructive skin growth, chronic OM.
	- **Eustachian Tube Dysfunction:** Middle ear; Leads to negative pressure/effusion.
2. **Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL): Affects Inner Ear/Nerve**
	- **Presbycusis:** Inner ear (cochlea); Age-related, high-frequency loss.
	- **Noise-Induced:** Inner ear (cochlea); Loud noise exposure, 4kHz notch.
	- **Meniere's Disease:** Inner ear (endolymph); Vertigo, tinnitus, fluctuating low-frequency SNHL.
	- **Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma):** CN VIII; Unilateral SNHL, tinnitus. (Bilateral in NF2).
	- **Ototoxicity:** Inner ear (hair cells); Drug-induced (e.g., aminoglycosides, diuretics, cisplatin).
	- **Viral Infections (e.g., Measles, Mumps):** Inner ear; Can cause sudden SNHL.
# Subtypes and variants
---
## Presbycusis
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">age-related, sensorineural hearing loss</span>
- Pathophysiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">progressive and irreversible damage of the hair cells of the organ of Corti (especially near the basal turn of the cochlea) that impairs high-frequency hearing</span>
- Epidemiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss</span>
	- Age 75: > 50%
	- Age 90: nearly 100%
- Clinical features
	- Progressive bilateral hearing loss, particularly of higher frequencies (using a low-pitched and clear voice to speak with older patients can improve communication)
	- Difficulty hearing in noisy, crowded environments.
	- Can cause depression and/or isolation
## Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL)
- Definition: hearing loss due to continuous exposure to sounds > 85 dB (e.g., during construction work, mining, welding) or a single exposure to sounds > 120 dB (e.g., gunshots, jet engines, fireworks)
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Repeated or constant exposure to noise > 85 dB → cumulative microtrauma and irreversible damage to the stereocilia of hair cells of the organ of Corti → sensorineural hearing loss</span>![Pasted image 20250324150501.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250324150501.png)
	- Sudden noise > 120 dB → tympanic membrane rupture → conductive hearing loss
- Clinical features
	- Slowly progressive hearing loss, beginning with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">loss of high-frequency hearing</span>
	- Difficulty hearing in noisy, crowded environments 
	- Difficulty hearing high-pitched voices (e.g., children's) occurs as the condition progresses.
- Treatment
	- There is no definitive treatment.
	- Hearing aids or cochlear implants
- Prevention: hearing protection (i.e., earplugs or earmuffs)
