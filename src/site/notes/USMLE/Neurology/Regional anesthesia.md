### 1. **[[USMLE/Neurology/Brachial plexus\|Brachial Plexus]] Block (for upper limb anesthesia)**

- **Injection site:**
    
    - **Interscalene block:** At the level of C6, between the anterior and middle scalene muscles.
    - **Supraclavicular block:** Above the clavicle, near the [[USMLE/Neurology/Brachial plexus\|brachial plexus]] trunks.
    - **Infraclavicular block:** Below the clavicle near the cords of the [[USMLE/Neurology/Brachial plexus\|brachial plexus]].
    - **Axillary block:** Near the axillary artery, at the level of the axilla.
- **Clinical relevance:** Used for surgeries of the shoulder, arm, forearm, and hand.
    
- **Key point:** Interscalene block can cause phrenic nerve paralysis (C3-C5), leading to diaphragmatic hemiparalysis.

### 2. **Epidural Anesthesia**

- **Injection site:**
    - Into the **epidural space**, typically at lumbar levels (L3-L4, L4-L5), via the ligamentum flavum.
- **Clinical relevance:** Used for labor analgesia, lower limb and abdominal surgeries.
- **Key point:** Avoid dural puncture to prevent post-dural puncture headache.

### 3. **Spinal Anesthesia**

- **Injection site:**
    - Into the **subarachnoid space**, usually at L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace.
- **Clinical relevance:** Used for lower limb, pelvic, and lower abdomen surgeries.
- **Key point:** Fast onset and denser block; risk of hypotension due to sympathetic blockade.

| Onset                | 10-20 min                                                                   | 2-5 min                                                      |
| Duration             | Variable, hours to days (infusion possible)                                 | Limited to single shot duration (1.5-4 h)                    |
| Block density        | Segmental; can be titrated                                                  | Dense and profound motor and sensory block                   |
| Sympathetic blockade | Variable, less profound                                                     | Usually marked hypotension                                   |
| Use                  | Labor analgesia, postoperative pain control, major thoracoabdominal surgery | Lower limb, pelvic, lower abdominal surgery with rapid onset |
| Main complications   | [[USMLE/Neurology/Epidural hematoma\|Epidural hematoma]]/abscess, accidental dural puncture, patchy block          | Post-dural puncture headache, hypotension, total spinal      |

### 4. **Sciatic Nerve Block**

- **Injection site:**
    - Posteriorly in the gluteal region or mid-thigh.
- **Clinical relevance:** Used for anesthesia of the lower limb below the knee.
- **Key point:** Useful in foot and ankle surgeries.

### 5. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Femoral Nerve Block**</span>

- **Injection site:**
    
    - Just distal to the inguinal ligament, lateral to the femoral artery and vein. The nerve lies lateral to the femoral artery in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">femoral triangle</span>.
- **Clinical relevance:**
    
    - Provides anesthesia to the anterior thigh, knee, and medial leg (via saphenous nerve branch).
    - Frequently used in surgeries involving the anterior thigh, knee arthroscopy, or for pain control after femur fractures.
- **Anatomical landmarks:**
    
    - Needle insertion usually at the level of the **femoral triangle**, found using the inguinal ligament superiorly, sartorius muscle laterally, and adductor longus muscle medially.
    - Palpate femoral artery, insert needle just lateral to artery.

### 6. **Digital Nerve Block**

- **Injection site:**
    - At the base of the fingers, near the digital nerves.
- **Clinical relevance:** For finger surgeries.
- **Key point:** Avoid intravascular injection to prevent systemic toxicity.
