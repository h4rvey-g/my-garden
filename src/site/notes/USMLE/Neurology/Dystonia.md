# Etiology
---
- Acquired
	- Drugs: dopamine antagonists
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High-potency typical [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotics]] (e.g., haloperidol) are more likely than atypical [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotics]] to induce acute dystonia.</span> 
		- Metoclopramide
	- Neurologic disorders: [[USMLE/Neurology/Huntington disease\|Huntington disease]]
	- Metabolic: [[USMLE/GI/Wilson disease\|Wilson disease]]
	- Psychogenic: [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Somatic symptom and related disorders\|conversion disorder]]

>[!tip] 
>Most cases of acute dystonia are caused by [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antipsychotics\|antipsychotic]] drugs.

# Clinical features
---
## Focal dystonia
Affects a single region of the body
### Conditions
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Spasmodic torticollis: cervical dystonia</span> 
	- The most common isolated focal dystonia. Predominantly affects the sternocleidomastoid muscle and trapezoid muscle.
	- Abnormal head movements or fixed head posture 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blepharospasm: eye dystonia (e.g., increased blinking or involuntary eye closure)</span>; usually bilateral, symmetrical
- Writer's dystonia (writer's cramp): non-painful contractions of hand muscles that are provoked by specific tasks (e.g., writing)
## Generalized dystonia
Affects the trunk and at least two additional regions of the body
### Conditions
- Neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia
# Treatment
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Levodopa/carbidopa</span>: A trial should be taken in all patients with childhood-onset dystonia to distinguish dopa-responsive dystonia from the other forms. 
- Anticholinergics (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl) or [[USMLE/Immunology/Antihistamines\|antihistamines]] (diphenhydramine)
- Periodic botulinum toxin injections: for focal dystonia 
- Deep brain stimulation 
- Treatment of underlying disorder of acquired dystonia (e.g., cessation of the causative drug)
- Supportive measures: physiotherapy, ergotherapy
