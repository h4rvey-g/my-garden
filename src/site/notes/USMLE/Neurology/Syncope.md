-   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:** The final common pathway is a transient drop in cerebral blood flow. The main causes are broadly categorized into three groups:
    1.  **Reflex (Neurally-Mediated) Syncope:** The most common cause, especially in younger individuals.
        *   **Vasovagal:** Triggered by stress, fear, pain, or prolonged standing. Involves a cardioinhibitory (vagal-mediated bradycardia) and/or vasodepressor (sympathetic withdrawal leading to vasodilation) response.
        *   **Situational:** Occurs with specific triggers like coughing, micturition, defecation, or [[USMLE/GI/Deglutition\|swallowing]].
        *   **Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity:** Triggered by pressure on the carotid sinus (e.g., tight collar, shaving).
    2.  **Orthostatic Hypotension:** Drop in BP upon standing (â†“ SBP >20 mmHg or DBP >10 mmHg).
        *   Causes include volume depletion (hemorrhage, dehydration), medications (e.g., [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Diuretics\|diuretics]], alpha-blockers, antihypertensives), and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., Parkinson's, [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]]).
    3.  **Cardiac Syncope:** Most concerning etiology due to high risk of sudden death.
        *   **Arrhythmias (most common cardiac cause):** Bradyarrhythmias (AV block, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Sick sinus syndrome\|sinus node dysfunction]]) or tachyarrhythmias (VT, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Supraventricular tachycardia\|SVT]]).
        *   **Structural Heart Disease:** [[USMLE/Cardiology/Aortic valve stenosis\|Aortic stenosis]], [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\|hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]] ([[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\|HCM]]), MI, massive PE, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade\|cardiac tamponade]].

-   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Reflex (Vasovagal):** Often preceded by a **prodrome** (nausea, diaphoresis, warmth, pallor, blurred vision). Typically occurs with a known trigger.
    *   **Orthostatic:** Occurs after standing up. History of volume loss or offending medications.
    *   **Cardiac:** Often **sudden onset without a prodrome**. Can be precipitated by exertion (suggests outflow obstruction like AS/[[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\|HCM]]) or occur at rest (suggests arrhythmia). Family history of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute coronary syndrome\|sudden cardiac death]] is a major red flag.

-   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Initial Evaluation (All Pts):** Thorough history, physical exam (including orthostatic vitals), and a **12-lead ECG**.
    *   **ECG:** Look for arrhythmias, evidence of prior MI (Q waves), ventricular hypertrophy, Brugada syndrome, prolonged/short QT, or WPW (delta wave).
    *   **Orthostatic Vitals:** Positive if SBP drops >20 mmHg, DBP drops >10 mmHg, or HR increases >20 bpm upon standing.
    *   **Further Testing (if indicated):**
        *   **Echocardiogram:** To evaluate for structural heart disease if murmur or ECG abnormality is present.
        *   **Ambulatory ECG Monitoring (Holter, event recorder):** For suspected arrhythmic cause.
        *   **Tilt-table test:** To confirm [[USMLE/Neurology/Vasovagal syncope\|vasovagal syncope]] if the diagnosis is uncertain.
        *   **Electrophysiology Study (EPS):** For high-risk patients with suspected tachyarrhythmia.

-   **DDx (of Transient Loss of Consciousness):**
    *   **Seizure:** Key differentiators include a **post-ictal state** (confusion, drowsiness), lateral tongue biting, and prolonged tonic-clonic movements. Syncope has a rapid return to baseline.
    *   **[[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|Hypoglycemia]]:** Requires metabolic workup (glucose check).
    *   **Stroke/TIA:** Usually associated with focal neurologic deficits. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency can cause syncope.
    *   **Mechanical Fall:** No true loss of consciousness.

-   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   **Reflex (Vasovagal):** Patient education on avoiding triggers. Counter-pressure maneuvers (e.g., leg crossing, hand gripping) during prodrome.
    *   **Orthostatic Hypotension:** Replete volume, adjust offending medications, advise slow postural changes.
    *   **Cardiac:** Treat the underlying cause.
        *   **Arrhythmia:** Pacemaker for bradycardia, ICD for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
        *   **Structural:** e.g., Aortic valve replacement for severe AS.

-   **Key Associations/Complications (RED FLAGS for Cardiac Syncope):**
    *   Syncope during exertion.
    *   No prodromal symptoms.
    *   Abnormal ECG.
    *   Personal history of structural heart disease or MI.
    *   Family history of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Acute coronary syndrome\|sudden cardiac death]] at a young age.
    *   Associated chest pain or shortness of breath.
