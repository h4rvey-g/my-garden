# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bordetella pertussis is a gram‑negative, obligate aerobic coccobacillus</span>.![b2a1d48fe8094cb3ed01f68272c4182e.jpg](/img/user/appendix/b2a1d48fe8094cb3ed01f68272c4182e.jpg)

# Pathophysiology
---
- Proliferation of Bordetella pertussis <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa → production of virulence factors (e.g., tracheal cytotoxin) → paralysis of respiratory epithelium cilia and inflammation → secretion of inflammatory exudate into respiratory tract → compromise of small airways → cough, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]], cyanosis</span>
- Bordetella pertussis produces <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">pertussis toxin</span> → ADP-ribosylation of the α subunit of Gi protein → inhibition of Gi protein → adenylate cyclase disinhibition → cAMP accumulation → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired cell signaling pathways → systemic manifestations associated with whooping cough (e.g., [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hypoglycemia\|hypoglycemia]], lymphocytosis, modulation of host immune response)</span>

# Clinical features
---
- Catarrhal (1-2 weeks): mild cough, rhinitis
- Paroxysmal (2-6 weeks): severe coughing spells with inspiratory whoop, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">posttussive emesis (risk of dehydration)</span>; ± apnea/cyanosis (infants)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lungs are usually clear to auscultation</span>
- Convalescent (weeks to months): gradual resolution

# Diagnostics

# Treatment
---
- First-line: macrolides
	- Preferred: azithromycin
