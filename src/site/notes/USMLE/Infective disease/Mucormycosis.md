# Mucormycosis
- **Patho/Etiology**
    - Caused by fungi of the order Mucorales (e.g., *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*).
    - Spores are inhaled and germinate in the upper airways or are inoculated through skin trauma.
    - **Angioinvasion** is the hallmark: hyphae invade blood vessels, causing thrombosis, ischemia, and extensive tissue necrosis.
    - Fungi thrive in high glucose and acidic environments.

- **Key Associations (Risk Factors)**
    - **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** is the most classic association.
    - Immunocompromised states: hematologic malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma), neutropenia, organ/stem cell transplant.
    - Long-term corticosteroid use.
    - Iron overload (e.g., hemochromatosis) and treatment with deferoxamine.
    - Severe trauma or burns.

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - Presentation depends on the site of infection. Forms include rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, GI, and disseminated.
    - **Rhinocerebral (most common):** Starts like acute sinusitis with facial pain, headache, and nasal congestion. Progresses rapidly to cause:

        - Periorbital swelling, proptosis, diplopia, and vision loss due to orbital invasion.
        - Cranial nerve palsies.
        - Altered mental status if it extends into the brain via the cribriform plate.
    - **Pulmonary:** Fever, cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis; often seen in neutropenic patients.
    - **Cutaneous:** Erythematous lesion progressing to a necrotic ulcer with a central black eschar, often at a site of trauma.

- **Diagnosis**
    - **Urgent tissue biopsy** is the gold standard for diagnosis.
    - **Histopathology:** Shows **broad, nonseptate (or pauciseptate) hyphae with wide-angle (90Â° or right-angle) branching.**![cd6200e8803a0d87239c6f474ba9157d.webp](/img/user/appendix/cd6200e8803a0d87239c6f474ba9157d.webp)
    - **Imaging (CT/MRI):** Used to assess the extent of sinus, orbital, and intracranial involvement. Findings include mucosal thickening and bony erosion.
    - Culture is often negative and should not delay treatment.

- **DDx (Differential Diagnosis)**
    - **Rhinocerebral:** Invasive aspergillosis (has septate hyphae with acute-angle branching), bacterial sinusitis (less rapid, no eschar), cavernous sinus thrombosis.
    - **Pulmonary:** Invasive aspergillosis, lung abscess, malignancy.
    - **Cutaneous:** Ecthyma gangrenosum (caused by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*), necrotizing fasciitis.

- **Management/Treatment**
    - A true medical and surgical emergency.
    - **1. Surgical Debridement:** Aggressive and immediate removal of all necrotic tissue is crucial.
    - **2. Antifungal Therapy:**
        - **First-line:** **Liposomal Amphotericin B** (IV).
        - **Alternatives/Step-down:** Posaconazole or Isavuconazole.
    - **3. Reverse Underlying Condition:** Control hyperglycemia and acidosis in DKA, reduce immunosuppressants if possible.

- **Complications**
    - Cavernous sinus thrombosis, carotid artery thrombosis.
    - Brain abscess, massive tissue destruction, blindness.
    - Disseminated disease and death. The overall mortality rate is very high (~50%).
