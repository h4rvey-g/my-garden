# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---
- Spirochetes invade the body → disseminate systemically within hours → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bind to endothelial cells</span> → inflammatory reaction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">endarteritis and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates</span>
	- May be obliterating if reactive endothelial hyperproliferation occurs and results in ischemia and necrosis.

# Clinical features
---
## Primary syphilis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primary lesion (chancre)</span> 
	- Typically starts out as a solitary, raised papule (usually on the genitals)
	- Evolves into a painless, firm ulcer with indurated borders and smooth base 
	- Resolves spontaneously within 3–6 weeks, typically without scarring 
- Nontender regional lymphadenopathy (e.g., involvement of the inguinal lymph nodes in genital primary syphilis)
## Secondary syphilis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Disseminated disease due to the systemic spread of the spirochetes</span>, inducing an immunologic reaction
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Begins approx. 2–12 weeks after primary infection</span> and typically lasts 2–6 weeks 
- Constitutional symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized nontender [[USMLE/Pathology/Lymphadenopathy\|lymphadenopathy]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever</span>, fatigue, myalgia, headache
- **Diffuse maculopapular rash**, classically involving the **palms and soles**.![L9512.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L9512.jpg)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Reddish-brown or copper-colored</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Condylomata lata:** smooth, white, painless, wart-like lesions in moist areas (genitals, perineum).</span>
- Additional lesions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patchy [[USMLE/MSK/Alopecia\|alopecia]] (moth-eaten [[USMLE/MSK/Alopecia\|alopecia]])</span>

# Diagnostics
---
## Nontreponemal Tests
- **Examples**: RPR, VDRL
- **Antibody**: to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen</span>
- **Sensitivity**: Lower sensitivity in early infection
## Treponemal Tests
- **Examples**: FTA-ABS, TP-EIA
- **Antibody**: to treponemal antigens
- **Sensitivity**: Greater sensitivity in early infection
