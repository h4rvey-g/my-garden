# Etiology
---
- Most common: Candida albicans (C. albicans)
	- A type of dimorphic fungus that can form:
		- Oval, budding yeast and hyphae and long pseudohyphae at 20oC 
		- Germ tubes at 37oC 
	- Ubiquitous on healthy skin as well as in the oropharyngeal cavity, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, and vagina
# Pathophysiology
---
- Local infection: imbalance in local flora (e.g., triggered by antibiotic use) → local overgrowth of C. albicans → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">local mucocutaneous infection (e.g., oropharyngeal infection, vaginitis)</span>
- Systemic (invasive) infection: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">local mucocutaneous infection → breach of skin/mucosal barrier or translocation (IV catheterization, ascending infection in pyelonephritis, or resorption via GIT)</span> → direct invasion of bloodstream (candidemia) → spread to visceral tissues → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">disseminated organ infection (e.g., pyelonephritis, endocarditis)</span>
