# Etiology
- Pathogen: Plasmodia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Plasmodium falciparum: most virulent and causes the most severe disease</span>, i.e., falciparum malaria; dominant in Africa
		- Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale primarily infect very young, large erythrocytes recently released from the bone marrow (ie, reticulocytes), whereas Plasmodium malariae primarily infects old erythrocytes that have been in the bloodstream for months.  In contrast, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Plasmodium falciparum has the unique ability to infect erythrocytes of all ages.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No hypnozoites; recrudescence may occur due to treatment failure, not true relapse.</span>
	- Plasmodium vivax: the most common of the less virulent species and causes milder disease; dominant in endemic areas outside Subsaharan Africa (e.g., Southeast Asia)
	- Plasmodium ovale and Plasmodium malariae: less common and cause milder disease

# Pathophysiology
## Asexual development in humans
![highresdefault_L25881.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L25881.jpg)
1. Transmission of Plasmodium sporozoites via Anopheles mosquito bite → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver of the host</span>
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Liver: sporozoites enter hepatocytes → sporozoites multiply asexually → schizonts are formed containing thousands of merozoites  → release of merozoites into the bloodstream</span>
3. Circulatory system (two possible outcomes)
	- Merozoites enter erythrocytes → maturation to trophozoites  → red cell schizonts are formed containing thousands of merozoites → release of merozoites into the bloodstream (which causes fever and other manifestations of malaria) → penetration of erythrocytes recurs
	- Merozoites enter erythrocytes → differentiation into gametocytes (male or female)
4. Following the successful treatment of tertian malaria, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dormant P. ovale or P. vivax forms (hypnozoites) may remain in the liver and can cause relapse after months or even years.</span>

# Treatment
## Antimalarial drugs
- Primaquine is the only antimalarial that attacks the hypnozoites, preventing relapse
- **Chloroquine:**
    
    - **MOA:** Blocks heme detoxification.
    - **Use:** Tx of sensitive malaria; Prophylaxis in sensitive areas.
    - **SE/CI:** Pruritus, retinopathy (chronic use). Widespread _P. falciparum_ resistance. Safe in pregnancy.
- **Primaquine / Tafenoquine:**
    
    - **MOA:** Kills liver hypnozoites (disrupts mitochondrial e- transport).
    - **Use:** Radical cure for _P. vivax & P. ovale_. Terminal prophylaxis (_P. vivax_).
    - **SE/CI:** **Hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficiency (MUST TEST!)**. Contraindicated in pregnancy, G6PD deficiency.
- **Artemisinins (IV Artesunate, Artemether-Lumefantrine):**
    
    - **MOA:** Free radical damage (via endoperoxide bridge activation by heme). Rapid acting.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Use:** **IV Artesunate = 1st line for SEVERE _P. falciparum_**. Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs) = 1st line for uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_.</span>
    - **SE/CI:** Generally well-tolerated. ACTs preferred. Artemether-lumefantrine often used in pregnancy.
- **Atovaquone-Proguanil (Malarone):**
    
    - **MOA:** Atovaquone (mito e- transport inhibitor) + Proguanil (DHFR inhibitor).
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Use:** Prophylaxis & Tx of chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_.</span>
    - **SE/CI:** GI upset (take with food). Contraindicated: severe renal impairment, pregnancy (generally).
- **Mefloquine:**
    
    - **MOA:** Unclear (likely heme polymerization inhibitor).
    - **Use:** Prophylaxis (weekly) & Tx of chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_.
    - **SE/CI:** **Neuropsychiatric effects (BLACK BOX WARNING!)** - vivid dreams, psychosis, seizures. Contraindicated: psychiatric disorders, seizures. Use with caution in pregnancy.
- **Quinine / Quinidine (IV):**
    
    - **MOA:** Unclear (likely heme polymerization inhibitor).
    - **Use:** Tx chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ (often + doxycycline/clindamycin). IV Quinidine for severe malaria if artesunate unavailable.
    - **SE/CI:** **Cinchonism (tinnitus, headache, dizziness)**, hypoglycemia, QTc prolongation.
- **Doxycycline:**
    
    - **MOA:** 30S ribosomal inhibitor.
    - **Use:** Prophylaxis (daily) for resistant malaria. Tx (with quinine) for resistant _P. falciparum_.
    - **SE/CI:** Photosensitivity, GI upset (esophagitis). Contraindicated: pregnancy, children <8 years.
- **Clindamycin:**
    
    - **MOA:** 50S ribosomal inhibitor.
    - **Use:** With quinine for resistant _P. falciparum_ (esp. pregnancy 1st trimester as alternative).
    - **SE/CI:** Diarrhea, _C. difficile_ colitis.
## Plans
- **Chloroquine-Resistant _P. falciparum_:**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Uncomplicated:** ACTs (e.g., Artemether-Lumefantrine) = First line.</span>
    - **Severe:** IV Artesunate = First line. (IV Quinidine + Doxycycline if artesunate unavailable).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**_P. vivax / P. ovale_ (Relapsing Malaria):** Treat blood stages (e.g., chloroquine if sensitive, or ACT) **PLUS** Primaquine or Tafenoquine for liver hypnozoites</span> (radical cure – _check G6PD status!_).
- **Prophylaxis (Chloroquine-Resistant Areas):** Atovaquone-Proguanil, Doxycycline, or Mefloquine.
- **Pregnancy:**
    - **Uncomplicated _P. falciparum_:** Artemether-lumefantrine preferred. Quinine + Clindamycin (esp. 1st trimester).
    - **Severe:** IV Artesunate.
    - **Contraindicated:** Doxycycline, Primaquine, Tafenoquine. Atovaquone-Proguanil generally avoided.
- **G6PD Deficiency:** **NO Primaquine or Tafenoquine.** Use Quinine with caution.

# Prevention
- Should be initiated before traveling to regions with a high risk of malaria, e.g., tropical Africa, Asia, and Central/South America
- Drug of choice is based on the region traveled and Plasmodium species
	- Areas with P. falciparum
		- If chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum (most malaria endemic regions): atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine
		- If chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum: chloroquine
	- Areas without P. falciparum (some areas of Central/South America, Mexico, China, South Korea): primaquine
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Agents that are safe during pregnancy: chloroquine, mefloquine</span>
>[!tip] 
>Prophylactic medication <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cannot prevent infection but instead suppresses the course of the disease and its symptoms</span> by killing the parasite within the host before it can cause severe disease. There is no prophylactic medication that provides protection against all species of the Plasmodium genus.
