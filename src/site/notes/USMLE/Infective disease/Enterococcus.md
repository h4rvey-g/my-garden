*   **Patho/Etiology:** Gram-positive cocci in pairs/short chains, catalase-negative, PYR-positive. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Part of normal GI/GU flora.</span> Two main species: ***E. faecalis*** (more common, more sensitive) and ***E. faecium*** (more virulent, more resistant). Notorious for antibiotic resistance. Virulence factors include biofilm formation (adherence to catheters, heart valves) and production of gelatinase and cytolysin.

*   **Clinical Presentation:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Primarily a **nosocomial pathogen**, especially in debilitated, post-operative, or immunocompromised patients</span> with prolonged hospital stays or indwelling devices (e.g., Foley catheters).
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs):** Most common infection, often catheter-associated.</span>
    *   **Bacteremia/Sepsis:** Can follow a UTI or GI/GU procedure.
    *   **Infective Endocarditis (IE):** A leading cause of subacute endocarditis, particularly after GI/GU manipulation.
    *   **Intra-abdominal/Biliary Tract Infections:** Often polymicrobial, associated with abscesses or biliary procedures.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   **Culture:** Grows in **6.5% NaCl** and **bile**, distinguishing it from non-enterococcal Group D Strep (like *S. gallolyticus/bovis*).
    *   **Hemolysis:** Typically gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis) on blood agar.
    *   **Urinalysis (for UTI):** May show leukocyte esterase but often **nitrite-negative** (unlike *E. coli*).

*   **Management/Treatment:** Treatment is guided by susceptibility testing due to high resistance rates.
    *   **Ampicillin/Amoxicillin:** Drug of choice for susceptible strains, especially *E. faecalis*.
    *   **Endocarditis:** Requires synergistic, bactericidal therapy, typically **Ampicillin + Gentamicin** (if susceptible to high-level aminoglycosides).
    *   **Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE):** A major concern. Resistance mediated by **vanA gene**, which alters the D-Ala-D-Ala peptidoglycan terminus to D-Ala-D-Lactate.
        *   **Tx for VRE:** **Linezolid** or **Daptomycin**. Tigecycline is another option.
    *   **Intrinsic Resistance:** Resistant to many cephalosporins, TMP-SMX, and clindamycin.

*   **Key Associations/Complications:**
    *   **Nosocomial Infections:** Strongly associated with hospital stays, ICU, and long-term care facilities.
    *   **Prior Antibiotic Use:** Broad-spectrum antibiotics (especially cephalosporins and vancomycin) select for Enterococcus.
    *   **VRE Transmission:** A significant infection control issue, transmitted via hands of healthcare workers. Requires contact precautions.
    *   **Buzzwords:** "Grows in 6.5% NaCl," "UTI after GU procedure," "Endocarditis after colonoscopy," "VRE," "D-Ala-D-Lac."
