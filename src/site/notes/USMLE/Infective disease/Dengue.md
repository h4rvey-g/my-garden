# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
There are 4 dengue virus serotypes, and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secondary infection with a different viral serotype is common</span> and is usually associated with more severe illness.

# Pathophysiology

# Clinical features
---
- Dengue fever (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nonhemorrhagic</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flu-like febrile illness with marked myalgia &/or arthralgia</span>
		- Often referred to as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">“break-bone fever”</span>
	- Diffuse maculopapular rash
	- Retroorbital pain
	- Leukopenia
- Severe dengue (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hemorrhagic</span>, formally called dengue hemorrhagic fever or DHF)
	- DHF typically occurs as a result of an antibody-dependent reaction in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">patients who are reinfected with a different serotype</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generally develops as the initial fever subsides (∼ 1 week after onset)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Temperature change: ranges from hypothermia to a second spike in fever</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Severe hemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., petechiae, ecchymoses, purpura, hematemesis, melena) due to thrombocytopenia (&lt 100,000/mm3)</span>
	- Severely <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased vascular permeability</span>
		- [[USMLE/Blood/Pleural effusion\|Pleural effusion]], respiratory distress
		- Ascites, abdominal pain
		- Severe ↑ or ↓ Hct
	- Positive tourniquet test (petechiae after sphygmomanometer cuff inflation for 5 min)
	- Spontaneous bleeding → shock
