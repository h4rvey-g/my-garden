# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Leptospira (especially L. interrogans sensu lato), a genus of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gram-negative spirochete with hook-shaped ends</span>![Pasted image 20250220201935.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250220201935.png)
	- Spirochetes cannot be visualized using Gram staining and require specialized staining methods.
- Transmission 
	- Sources
		- Urine, blood, or tissue of an infected animal (most commonly rats)
		- Environmental contamination (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">water contaminated with urine of infected animals</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Entry points: broken skin or exposed mucous membranes (e.g., conjunctiva, oral mucosa)</span>
	- Risk factors
		- Occupations that involve direct or indirect contact with animals (e.g., agricultural or sewage workers)
		- Freshwater recreational activities (e.g., canoeing, swimming, windsurfing)
