# Epidemiology
---
Most commonly found in tropical climates

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Leptospira (especially L. interrogans sensu lato), a genus of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">gram-negative spirochete with hook-shaped ends</span>![Pasted image 20250220201935.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250220201935.png)
	- Spirochetes cannot be visualized using Gram staining and require specialized staining methods.
- Transmission 
	- Sources
		- Urine, blood, or tissue of an infected animal (most commonly rats)
		- Environmental contamination (e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">water contaminated with urine of infected animals</span>)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Entry points: broken skin or exposed mucous membranes (e.g., conjunctiva, oral mucosa)</span>
	- Risk factors
		- Occupations that involve direct or indirect contact with animals (e.g., agricultural or sewage workers)
		- Freshwater recreational activities (e.g., canoeing, swimming, windsurfing)

# Clinical features
---
- **Biphasic illness** is characteristic.
- **Phase 1: Septicemic/Acute Phase (1 week)**
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abrupt onset of flu-like symptoms: high fever, chills, severe myalgias</span> (classically in **calves** and lumbar area), headache.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Conjunctival suffusion** (redness without exudate) is a key finding.</span>![Pasted image 20250220201810.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250220201810.png)
	- Photophobia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea may occur.
- **Phase 2: Immune Phase**
	- Recurrence of fever after a brief remission.
	- May lead to **aseptic meningitis**.
- **Weil's Disease (Severe Icteric Leptospirosis)**
	- Severe form in ~10% of cases.
	- Triad of **jaundice** (hepatic dysfunction), **renal failure** (azotemia), and **hemorrhage** (thrombocytopenia).
	- Can progress to multi-organ failure, ARDS (pulmonary hemorrhage), and shock.
