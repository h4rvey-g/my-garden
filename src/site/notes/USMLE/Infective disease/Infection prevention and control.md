| Agent                           | Mechanism                                                           | Sporicidal | Why                                                                                                                 |

| Alcohols (isopropanol, ethanol) | Disruption of cell membranes, Denaturation of proteins              | No         | Dissolves membrane lipids; disrupts protein structure (requires water for optimal protein denaturation).            |
| Chlorhexidine                   | Disruption of cell membranes, Coagulation of cytoplasm              | No         | Cationic; binds to negatively charged cell walls, disrupting membranes and causing leakage, inhibits ATP synthesis. |
| Hydrogen peroxide               | Produces destructive free radicals that oxidize cellular components | Yes        | Generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals that damage lipids, proteins, and DNA.                                  |
| Iodine                          | Halogenation of proteins & nucleic acids                            | Yes        | Adds halogen atoms to proteins and DNA, disrupting their structure and function, penetrates the cell wall quickly.  |

>[!tip] 
>Alcohols and chlorhexidine are not sporicidal because they both target on cell membrane, but spores have tough, multi-layered coats protecting membrane.
# Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections (CLABSIs and CRBSIs)

- Procedural
	- Consider a peripherally inserted central line (PICC). ![Pasted image 20241129093834.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241129093834.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Use of subclavian or internal jugular insertion sites (femoral vein has a higher risk of infection)</span>
	- For the procedure:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Perform skin preparation with chlorhexidine and alcohol.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Follow hand hygiene and strict aseptic technique. </span>
		- Place the line under ultrasound guidance. 
- Postprocedural
	- Replace lines that were inserted emergently within 2 days. 
	- Perform regular maintenance.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary</span> for functional catheters with no evidence of infection.
