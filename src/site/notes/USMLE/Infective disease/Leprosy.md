# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Mycobacterium leprae is an obligate, intracellular, acid-fast bacillus that cannot be cultured and thrives in cold temperatures. 
- Route of transmission 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Close contact with fomites, contaminated soil, infected individuals, and nine-banded armadillos (in rare cases)</span> 
	- Respiratory droplet transmission
		- Risk factors are close contact with infected individuals or contaminated soil.

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The range of clinical manifestations depends on the strength of the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tuberculoid leprosy (TT) is the least severe form and is often self-limited.</span>  Mycobacterial infection is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">limited by an intact CMI response (Th1-mediated).</span>  Mild skin plaques develop and are associated with hypopigmentation, hair follicle loss, and focally decreased sensation.
	- Nerve demyelination is the result of a T-cell mediated response. 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cells cross the perineurium and destroy Schwann cells and axons. The epineurium is fibrotic and the endoneurium is replaced by granulomas.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lepromatous leprosy (LL), the most severe form,</span> occurs in patients with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weak CMI response (Th2-mediated).</span>  Macrophage signaling to kill M leprae is limited, leading to mycobacterial dissemination.  Manifestations include diffuse skin thickening, plaque-like hypopigmentation (often with hair loss), leonine facies, paresis, regional anesthesia, testicular destruction, and blindness.
	- Nerve lesions are the result of M. leprae invasion.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">M. leprae thrives at cool areas on the body (skin, mucous membranes, peripheral nerves, anterior chamber of the eye, upper respiratory tract, testes). </span>

# Clinical features
---
Both: Nerve involvement leads to nerve enlargement and peripheral nerve palsies which present with sensory, motor, and/or autonomic deficits.
## Tuberculoid leprosy (TT)
* **Cutaneous manifestations**
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Few (usually 1–3 lesions), localized, hypopigmented</span> macules, plaques, and/or papules with well-defined, erythematous, and/or raised margins![Pasted image 20250524160235.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250524160235.png)
    * Lesions are dry, scaly, anhidrotic.
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hair loss</span>
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperesthesia of the skin lesion is common and occurs early (hypoaesthesia of the skin develops in later stages).</span>
* **Nerve Involvement**
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Occurs early but is localized.</span>
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asymmetric enlargement of one or many peripheral nerves.</span>
    * Acute neuritis does not occur.

## Lepromatous leprosy (LL)
* **Cutaneous manifestations**
    * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple symmetrical</span> macules, plaques, and/or nodules
        * Generalized involvement of the skin
        * <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nodules on the face may coalesce → leonine facies</span>
        * Nodules may ulcerate
    * Hypesthesia of the skin lesion is less common and occurs only in the late stages of the disease.
    * Supraciliary and ciliary madarosis
* Nerve Involvement
	* Occurs late, but is more extensive.
	* <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Acral, distal, symmetrical anesthesia.</span>
	- Usually begins with stocking glove pattern that spreads proximally.
	* Nerve involvement leads to nerve enlargement and peripheral nerve palsies which present with sensory, motor, and/or autonomic deficits.
		* [[USMLE/MSK/Ulnar nerve entrapment\|Ulnar nerve]] palsy: clawing of the fourth and fifth fingers, wasting of dorsal interosseous nerves, loss of sensation
		* Peroneal nerve palsy: foot drop
		* Posterior auricular nerve
		* Posterior tibial nerve


# Diagnostics
---
The lepromin skin test (in which M leprae antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy.  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patients with tuberculoid leprosy will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for M [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]]).  In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy due to their weak TH1 cell-mediated immune response.</span>

# Treatment
---
## Dapsone
- Mechanism of action
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Competitive antagonist of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for dihydropteroate synthetase → inhibition of dihydrofolic acid synthesis</span>
	- Structurally different from sulfonamides but a similar mechanism of action
- Clinical use
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">M. leprae: lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy</span>
	- P. jiroveci [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]]
		- Prophylaxis
		- Treatment: used in combination with TMP as an alternative to TMP/SMX
- Adverse effects
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Respiratory/Methemoglobinemia\|Methemoglobinemia]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Triggers [[USMLE/Blood/Hemolytic anemia\|hemolytic anemia]] in patients with [[USMLE/Blood/Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency\|G6PD deficiency]]</span>
	- Agranulocytosis
