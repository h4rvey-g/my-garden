# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Caused by encapsulated yeast: **_Cryptococcus neoformans_** (worldwide, associated with **pigeon droppings**, immunocompromised hosts) and **_C. gattii_** (tropical/subtropical areas, can infect immunocompetent hosts).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transmission is via **inhalation** of spores. The primary infection is in the lungs, often asymptomatic.</span>
- Hematogenous dissemination to the **CNS** is the most common and feared manifestation, especially in immunocompromised individuals.
- The thick **polysaccharide capsule** is a major virulence factor, inhibiting phagocytosis.

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Cryptococcal meningoencephalitis or brain abscess
	- Hematogenous spread of fungi to meninges
	- Headache, fever, signs of increased intracranial pressure, confusion, absent meningeal signs
- Pulmonary cryptococcosis
	- Most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients
	- Clinical presentation is variable and nonspecific (e.g., cough, fever, shortness of breath).

# Diagnostics
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Latex agglutination test</span>: positive for cryptococcal polysaccharide capsular antigen![Pasted image 20240821144843.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240821144843.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">High specificity and sensitivity</span>
	- Specimen: Blood or CSF
- CSF analysis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">India ink stain: clear halo; Round or oval budding yeast</span>![Pasted image 20240106112607.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240106112607.png)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mucicarmine: stains the thick inner polysaccharide capsule bright red </span>![Pasted image 20240106112644.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240106112644.png)
	- Fungal culture (Sabouraud agar) showing:
		- 5–10 μm yeast
		- Thick polysaccharide capsule
		- Narrow, unequal budding
- MRI: “Soap bubble” lesions in cryptococcal encephalitis
