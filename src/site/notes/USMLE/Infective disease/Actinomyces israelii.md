# Etiology
---
## Pathogen
- Actinomyces are primarily anaerobic, gram-positive, non-acid fast, branching, rod-shaped bacteria.
- Actinomyces bacteria, particularly Actinomyces israelii, are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">found in the normal oral flora.</span>
## Predisposing factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cervicofacial actinomycosis (most frequent form of actinomycosis)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Poor dental hygiene (e.g., dental caries) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oral surgery (e.g., tooth extraction)</span>
	- Maxillofacial trauma
	- Local tissue inflammation (e.g., tonsillitis, tumor)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Comorbidities (e.g., [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]])</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abdominal and pelvic actinomycosis</span> (See [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pelvic inflammatory disease\|PID]])
	- Intestinal surgery 
	- Foreign body ingestion
	- Tumor
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ascending infection from the uterus, associated with intra-uterine contraceptive devices</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thoracic actinomycosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">History of aspiration</span>
	- Recent oral infection
# Clinical features
---
- Cervicofacial actinomycosis 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slowly progressive mass in the neck and/or face; most commonly in the mandible region</span>
	- Usually <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">painless nodular lesions</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Becomes indurated with purulent discharge that contains **sulfur granules**  from fistulae and draining sinus tracts.</span>![Pasted image 20240320110002.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240320110002.png)
		- Sulfur granules refer to macroscopic grains – approx. 1 mm in diameter – of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hard clumps of bacterial filaments, pus, debris, and hyaline</span>. The granules appear yellow within pus, although despite the name they do not contain sulfur.
- Thoracic actinomycosis
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough, chest pain</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible hemoptysis with yellow granules</span>

>[!tip] 
>Definitive diagnosis is based on the identification of actinomycotic sulfur granules or bacteria.

# Diagnostics
---
- Microscopy: direct visualization and staining of specimen → accumulations of radially protruding and branching Actinomyces (conglomerates with a “cauliflower-like” appearance) that are surrounded by numerous granulocytes![L61462.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L61462.jpg)

![Pasted image 20230807151432.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230807151432.png)
>An aggregate of basophilic bacteria with radially branching filaments is visible at the center, which has a cauliflower-like appearance (yellow overlay).  
The bacteria are surrounded by numerous granulocytes, resulting in a lesion with a rosette-like pattern (green overlay).

This is the typical histopathological appearance of a yellow “sulfur granule” caused by actinomycosis.

# Treatment
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Penicillin</span>
