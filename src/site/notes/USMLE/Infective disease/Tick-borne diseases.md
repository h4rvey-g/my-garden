# Ehrlichiosis
---
- Pathogens
	- Ehrlichia chaffeensis
- Vectors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lone star tick</span> (Amblyomma americanum): E. chaffeensis and E. ewingii
	- Deer tick (Ixodes scapularis): E. muris eauclairensis
- Distribution
	- Mainly east of the Rocky Mountains
	- Also some cases in the Southwest
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, myalgia)</span>
	- Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/GI/Hepatomegaly\|Hepatomegaly]]</span>
	- Rarely, symptoms of [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]] and/or encephalitis (e.g., headache, altered mental status, stiff neck, neurological deficits)
	- Sometimes an erythematous maculopapular or petechial rash 
		- Adults: ∼ 30% of cases
		- Children: ∼ 60% of cases
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral blood smear</span> (with Wright stain or Giemsa stain): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leukocytes with morulae (clustered inclusion bodies that resemble a mulberry)</span>![Pasted image 20250113165758.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250113165758.png)
		- E. chaffeensis infection: morulae within monocytes
# Tick paralysis
---
- Definition: a rare syndrome caused by the salivary neurotoxin of certain ticks, characterized by acute ataxia, that progresses to ascending paralysis
- Distribution: most commonly in the Rocky Mountains and northwestern US
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Paralysis is caused by tick neurotoxin, which is produced in the tick's salivary gland and introduced into the person's blood.</span>
- Clinical features
	- Symptoms begin within 2–7 days of the initial tick bite.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Typically starts with weakness in the lower extremities</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Escalates to ascending flaccid paralysis that progresses rapidly and can lead to respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness</span>
	- Sensory deficits are usually absent.
	- Cranial nerve palsies may occur (e.g., [[USMLE/Neurology/Oculomotor nerve palsy (III)\|CN III palsy]]).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">No fever or rash</span>
- Treatment
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Locate and remove the tick</span>
		- Removal of ticks usually results in improvement within 1 hour w/ recovery after several days
