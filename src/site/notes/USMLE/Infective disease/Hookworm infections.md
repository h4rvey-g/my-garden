- Pathogen 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Human hookworms: Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus</span>
	- Zoonotic hookworms, i.e., cat and dog hookworms (Ancylostoma braziliense and Ancylostoma caninum) can also infect humans.
	- Hookworms are nematodes.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mode of transmission: percutaneous penetration of larvae (primarily via the feet, e.g., while walking on a beach) </span>
- Life cycle
	- Human hookworm: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Soil is contaminated with human feces containing hookworm eggs</span> → Eggs hatch and release larvae → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Larvae penetrate skin (usually the feet)</span> → Larvae migrate to lungs via blood and lymphatic vessels → Larvae migrate via bronchi and trachea to the larynx → Larvae are expectorated and swallowed back into the intestine → Larvae mature into adult worms that colonize the intestinal tract → Female hookworms lay eggs in the intestine → Eggs are eliminated with the feces. 
	- Zoonotic hookworms are usually unable to break through the basement membrane after entering the human epidermis (humans are accidental intermediate hosts) → Migration through the epidermis for several weeks.
- Clinical features
	- Cutaneous symptoms
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">At entry site: pruritus, erythema, maculopapular rash</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM): serpiginous marks (cutaneous lesion with a progressive, creeping, snake-like border) representing larval tracks </span>
	- In zoonotic hookworm infections, only cutaneous symptoms are present.
	- Respiratory tract: dry cough, wheezing, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loeffler syndrome</span>
	- Intestine: abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]] 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Microcytic anemia (hookworms ingest blood from the intestinal wall)</span>
