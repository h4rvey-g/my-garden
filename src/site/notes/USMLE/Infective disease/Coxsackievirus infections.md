## Definition
Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">highly contagious febrile infections</span> most commonly caused by group A coxsackieviruses.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HFMD manifests with a cutaneous rash and painful oral lesions.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Herpangina manifests with painful lesions limited to the oral cavity.</span> (basically HFMD without cutaneous rash)
## Epidemiology
- Most commonly affects children < 5 years of age 
## Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever</span>, malaise
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painful oral lesions</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Initially manifest as discrete small papules that develop into 1–2 mm vesicles with surrounding erythema</span> 
	- Enlarge over several days to form 3–4 mm ulcers that do not coalesce 
	- Typically affect the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">posterior oral cavity</span> (e.g., tonsils, uvula, soft palate, oropharynx)
