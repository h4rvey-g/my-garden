# Epidemiology

# Etiology
---
- Pathogen 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi: typhoid fever</span>
		- Gram-negative rod
		- Facultative anaerobe with peritrichous flagella
		- Produces hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on TSI agar
		- Oxidase-negative
		- Cannot ferment lactose
	- Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi: paratyphoid fever
- Reservoir
	- Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi: humans
	- Other Salmonella species: humans and animals
- Transmission: fecal-oral
# Pathophysiology
---
## Lifecycle
1. Oral uptake of pathogen: A relatively large number of organisms (∼ 105) is needed to cause infection (high infective dose), unlike, e.g., in Shigella infection, where as few as ∼ 10 organisms suffice to infect the host.
2. Migration into the Peyer patches of the distal ileum: If the pathogen manages to reach the distal ileum, it migrates via M cells through the epithelium and into the Peyer patches.
3. Infection of macrophages  → nonspecific symptoms
4. Spread from macrophages to the bloodstream → septicemia → systemic disease
5. Migration back to intestine → excretion in feces

>[!tip] 
>**Key features:**
> - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">"Rose spots" (faint, salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen)</span>
> - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relative bradycardia (pulse-temperature dissociation), where the pulse is slower than expected for the degree of fever.</span>

## Week 1
- Body temperature rises gradually. 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relative bradycardia (not seen in children)</span> 
	- Physiologically, the heart rate increases in proportion to body temperature (for every degree Fahrenheit, the heart rate should increase ∼ 10 beats/min). In typhoid fever, this physiological response is typically reduced. Thus, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">the heart rate is only moderately increased despite a high fever</span>, which is known as relative bradycardia.
	- The Salmonella typhi bacteria releases endotoxins that affect the autonomic nervous system, specifically dampening the sympathetic response that would normally increase heart rate with fever.
- [[USMLE/GI/Constipation\|Constipation]] or diarrhea
## Week 2
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Persistent fever, but no chills; mostly unresponsive to antipyretics</span>
	- The lack of chills is interesting and relates to how the fever develops:
		- In most infections, bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, causing sudden spikes in endotoxin levels that trigger rapid temperature increases (accompanied by chills)
		- In typhoid, because the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bacteria live inside cells and release endotoxins gradually</span>, there isn't the sudden change in temperature that would cause chills
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rose-colored spots: a faint, salmon-colored exanthem that appears on the lower chest and abdomen</span> (most commonly around the navel) in approx. 30% of affected individuals![581c98dba97eb.jpg](/img/user/appendix/581c98dba97eb.jpg)
- Nonspecific abdominal pain and headache
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Yellow-green diarrhea</span>, comparable to pea soup (caused by purulent, bloody necrosis of the Peyer patches), or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obstipation and bowel obstruction (as a result of swollen Peyer patches in the ileum)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurological symptoms ([[USMLE/Psychiatry/Delirium\|delirium]], coma)</span>
## Week 3
- Clinical features of week 2
- Additional possible complications include:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gastrointestinal ulceration with bleeding and perforation</span> 
		- The pathogen induces necrotic intestinal inflammation (especially in the Peyer patches), which may result in a severe disease course with intestinal rupture and fecal peritonitis.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatosplenomegaly</span>
	- In rare cases: [[USMLE/Infective disease/Sepsis\|sepsis]], meningitis, myocarditis, and renal failure
