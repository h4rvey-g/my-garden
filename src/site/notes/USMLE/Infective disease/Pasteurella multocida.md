## **Patho/Etiology**

*   **Organism:** A small, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**gram-negative coccobacillus**</span> that is facultatively anaerobic. It possesses a polysaccharide capsule, a key virulence factor, and exhibits bipolar staining ("safety pin" appearance).
*   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Source:** It is a common commensal in the upper respiratory tracts of various animals, especially **cats and dogs**.</span>
*   **Transmission:** Primarily through **animal bites or scratches**, particularly from cats. Transmission can also occur via licking of open wounds or inhalation of respiratory droplets.

---

## **Clinical Presentation**

*   **Classic Presentation:** **Rapidly progressive cellulitis** at the site of an animal bite or scratch, typically developing within **24 hours**. The area becomes erythematous, swollen, and markedly tender, often with purulent or serosanguinous drainage.
*   **Systemic Symptoms:** Fever, [[USMLE/Pathology/Lymphadenopathy\|lymphadenopathy]], and signs of systemic illness can occur.
*   **Buzzwords:** **"Dog bite"** or **"cat bite"** followed by a rapidly developing skin infection.

---

## **Diagnosis**

*   **Clinical:** Diagnosis is often based on the classic history of animal exposure followed by rapid onset of cellulitis.
*   **Lab:** **Gram stain** of wound exudate shows gram-negative coccobacilli.
*   **Culture:** Definitive diagnosis is made by culturing the organism from the wound or blood. It grows well on **5% sheep blood agar**.

## **DDx**

*   **_[[USMLE/Infective disease/Staphylococcus aureus\|Staphylococcus aureus]]_ / _[[USMLE/Infective disease/Streptococcus pyogenes\|Streptococcus pyogenes]]_:** Common causes of cellulitis, but the onset is typically less rapid than with _Pasteurella_.
*   **_Capnocytophaga canimorsus_:** Another organism found in dog oral flora, which can cause severe [[USMLE/Infective disease/Sepsis\|sepsis]], particularly in asplenic or immunocompromised patients.
*   **Anaerobic infections:** Often part of a polymicrobial wound infection following a bite.

---

## **Management/Treatment**

*   **Wound Care:** Crucial first step involves **thorough irrigation and debridement** of the wound.
*   **First-line [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|Antibiotics]]:** **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** is the empiric drug of choice as it covers _Pasteurella_ and other common oral flora (aerobes and anaerobes) from animal mouths.
*   **Penicillin Allergy:** Alternatives include doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or a fluoroquinolone.
*   **Prophylaxis:** Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for high-risk bites (e.g., deep puncture wounds from cat bites, bites to the hand, or in immunocompromised patients).

---

## **Key Associations/Complications**

*   **Local Complications:** The infection can spread to deeper tissues, leading to:
    *   **Tenosynovitis**
    *   **[[USMLE/MSK/Septic arthritis\|Septic arthritis]]**
    *   **[[USMLE/MSK/Osteomyelitis\|Osteomyelitis]]**, especially common after deep penetrating cat bites.
*   **Systemic/Invasive Disease (less common):**
    *   **Bacteremia and [[USMLE/Infective disease/Sepsis\|Sepsis]]**
    *   **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|Meningitis]]**
    *   **[[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|Pneumonia]] or lung abscesses**, particularly in patients with pre-existing chronic lung disease.
*   **High-Risk Populations:** Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., due to [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes]], liver [[USMLE/GI/Cirrhosis\|cirrhosis]], or [[USMLE/Blood/Asplenia\|asplenia]]) and the elderly are at increased risk for severe and disseminated infections.
