# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- HIV is considered tropic for a certain cell type, depending on whether it preferentially binds to CCR5 or CXCR4 for viral entry, as follows:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">R5 virus uses CCR5 for viral entry and is considered macrophage-tropic because CCR5 is expressed in high concentrations on both macrophages and lymphocytes.  R5 is the predominant HIV type (> 90%).</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X4 virus uses CXCR4 for viral entry and is considered T lymphotropic because CXCR4 is expressed primarily on T lymphocytes but only minimally on macrophages.</span>
- HIV trophism is determined by a gene sequence in the variable (V3) region of the env gene, which encodes for the HIV surface glycoprotein 120.  This glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to the CD4 receptor and chemokine coreceptor.

# Pathophysiology
---
## Natural history of HIV infection
1. HIV enters the body (e.g., via mucosal lesions or via infection of mucosal/cutaneous immune cells.), then attaches to the CD4 receptor on host cells with its gp120 glycoprotein (binding)
	- Cells that have CD4 receptors: T lymphocytes (e.g., T helper cells), macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells.
2. Viral envelope fuses with host cell, capsid enters the cell.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">For fusion, CD4 receptor and a coreceptor (CCR5 in macrophages, and CCR5 or CXCR4 in T-cells) must be present.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Viral entry into macrophages via CCR5 mainly occurs during the early stages of infection, while entry via CXCR4 occurs in later stages.</span>
	- Individuals without CCR5 receptors appear to be resistant to HIV, those patients either have a homozygous CCR5 mutation (substantial resistance) or a heterozygous CCR5 mutation (slower course).
3. A virion's RNA is transcribed into dsDNA by viral reverse transcriptase and then integrated into the host's DNA by viral integrase.
4. Viral DNA is replicated and virions are assembled
5. Virion repurposes a portion of the cell's membrane as an envelope and leaves the cell (budding) → cell death

# Clinical features

## Acute HIV infection
- Also referred to as <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acute retroviral syndrome</span> (ARS) or described as a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mononucleosis-like syndrome </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fatigue</span>
	- Myalgia and arthralgia
	- Headache
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized nontender lymphadenopathy </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Generalized rash </span>
	- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, [[USMLE/GI/Diarrhea\|diarrhea]], weight loss)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Oropharyngeal symptoms (sore throat, ulcerations, painful swallowing)</span>

>[!tip] 
>Acute retroviral syndrome is associated with <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extremely high levels of viral replication</span> (~5 million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">not yet fully activated</span>.  
>Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">show evidence of HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a negative serologic response (negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody).</span>
>This is referred to as the "window period," as patients are infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection).

See [[USMLE/Infective disease/HIV therapy\|HIV therapy]]

# HIV in pregnancy

- The transmission risk depends on maternal viral load.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)</span> is recommended throughout pregnancy and delivery. See [[USMLE/Infective disease/HIV therapy#ART regimens\|HIV therapy#ART regimens]]
	- In untreated individuals, rates of vertical transmission are as high as 30%. Effective maternal cART and neonatal zidovudine therapy can reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission to < 2%.
