# Etiology
---
- Pathogen: Corynebacterium diphtheriae
	- A gram-positive, nonsporulating, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">club-shaped bacillus </span>
	- Contains <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">metachromatic granules (volutin granules; stain red with a blue dye)</span>![Pasted image 20240507144447.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240507144447.png)
- Route of infection 
	- Droplet transmission
# Pathophysiology
---
- C. diphtheriae has both toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">toxigenic strains contain a beta-prophage gene (tox)</span>, which encodes for the exotoxin diphtheria toxin
	- Conversion from nontoxigenic to toxigenic C diphtheriae occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">due to infection with a lysogenic bacteriophage</span> called Corynephage beta.  
	- This phage inserts the tox gene into the C diphtheriae genome, which results in the bacterial expression of the diphtheria AB toxin.  
	- Diphtheria toxin irreversibly halts protein synthesis due to ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2 and causes severe local (eg, pseudomembranous pharyngitis) and systemic (eg, [[USMLE/Cardiology/Myocarditis\|myocarditis]], neuritis) effects.
# Clinical features
---
## Local features
- Tonsillar and pharyngeal diphtheria
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Grayish-white pseudomembrane</span> over the posterior pharyngeal wall, and/or tonsils. Also see [[USMLE/Infective disease/Gray-white exudates of throat\|Gray-white exudates of throat]].
	- Any attempt to scrape off the pseudomembrane exposes the underlying capillaries and results in heavy bleeding.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bull neck due to cervical lymphadenopathy and swelling of the soft tissue of the neck â†’ airway obstruction</span>
## Systemic features (due to dissemination of toxin)
- Cardiac <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(can be lethal)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Myocarditis\|Myocarditis]]</span>
	- Arrhythmias
- Reversible [[USMLE/Neurology/Polyneuropathy\|polyneuropathy]]
# Diagnostics
---
- Cultures
	- Microscopic examination: multiple Gram-positive club-shaped bacilli clustered in angular arrangements
	- Culture media of choice
		- Cystine-tellurite agar: C. diphtheriae appears as black colonies.
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Loffler medium: shows metachromatic granules</span>
- Tests to identify toxigenic strains (if the culture reveals C. diphtheriae)
	- Elek test
		- Positive if the strain is toxicogenic
# Treatment
---
- Diphtheria antitoxin (most important)
- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|Antibiotics]]
