# Definition
- Legionellosis: an infection caused by Legionella spp.
- Legionnaires' disease: a type of legionellosis that manifests as [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia\|Pneumonia#Atypical pneumonia]]
- Pontiac fever: a type of legionellosis that manifests with flu-like symptoms without [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]].
# Epidemiology
- Manifests almost exclusively in adults
- Locations at increased risk of a legionella outbreak include:
	- Nursing homes
	- Hospitals
	- Confined travel accommodations (e.g., cruise ships, hotels, resorts)
# Clinical features
- Incubation period: 2–10 days
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fever >39 C (102.2 F)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bradycardia relative to high fever</span>
- Severe atypical [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]]: dry cough which can become productive, shortness of breath, bilateral crackles
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Several days of gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) prior to developing pulmonary symptoms</span>
- Neurological features, especially confusion, agitation, and stupor

> [!tip] 
> Legionnaires' disease should always be considered in patients with signs of atypical pneumonia and diarrhea in combination with possible exposure (e.g., cruise ship travel, use of a whirlpool).

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Legionella urinary antigen test</span> 
	- Most important diagnostic tool
	- High specificity, high sensitivity, fast (results available within 15 minutes)
- Microbiological studies
	- Legionella culture (gold standard) 
		- Requires buffered charcoal yeast extract agar with iron and cysteine 
		- Slow (results typically after 3–5 days)
	- Sample stains
		- Gram stain of respiratory secretions typically shows many neutrophils but no organisms. 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Visualization of Legionella requires [[USMLE/Infective disease/Silver stain\|silver stain]].</span>
