# Virulence factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Antiphagocytic capsule</span>
	- B. anthracis is the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">only bacterium</span> that is capable of forming a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">polypeptide capsule </span>
		- Most bacterial capsules are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">polysaccharides</span> (long chains of sugar molecules).
		- The **PGA capsule** of _B. anthracis_ has the distinct functional advantages of being **highly resistant to host proteases** due to its D-amino acid/γ-linkage structure and being **inherently poorly immunogenic**, making it an exceptionally effective shield against both innate and adaptive immunity.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains poly-D-glutamate</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The capsule protects the bacterium from lysis following phagocytosis. B. anthracis is not infectious if not encapsulated.</span>
- Anthrax toxin: responsible for the local and systemic manifestations of anthrax; made up of A and B subunits
	- The A subunit has 2 components:
		- EF (edema factor): binds to calcium and calmodulin and gains adenylate cyclase activity �?�?cAMP �?cell edema
		- LF (lethal factor): a metalloprotease that destroys MAPKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase ) �?cell death 
	- The B subunit (PA; anthrax toxin protective antigen) binds to endothelial receptors and facilitates entry of the A subunit into the host cell.
