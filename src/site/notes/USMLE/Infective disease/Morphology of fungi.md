# 1. Basic Forms

*   **Yeast**
    *   **Morphology:** Unicellular, round/oval shape.
    *   **Reproduction:** Primarily by **budding** (asexual).
    *   **Colonies:** Appear smooth, mucoid, or creamy, similar to bacterial colonies.
    *   **Examples:** *Candida albicans*, *Cryptococcus neoformans*, *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

*   **Mold (Mycelium)**
    *   **Morphology:** Multicellular, composed of filamentous structures called **hyphae**. A tangled mass of hyphae is called a **mycelium**.
    *   **Reproduction:** Via asexual or sexual spores.
    *   **Colonies:** Appear fuzzy, hairy, or woolly.
    *   **Examples:** *Aspergillus*, *Rhizopus*, *Penicillium*.

*   **Pseudohyphae**
    *   Chains of elongated yeast cells that fail to detach after budding.

    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Classic Example:** *Candida albicans*.</span>

# 2. Hyphae Types (Molds)

*   **Septate Hyphae**
    *   Hyphae are divided by cross-walls called **septa**.
    *   Septa have pores allowing communication between cells.
    *   **Medically Important Examples:** *Aspergillus* (acute angle branching), Dermatophytes.

*   **Aseptate (Coenocytic) Hyphae**
    *   Lack septa, appearing as continuous, multinucleated tubes. This allows for rapid growth.
    *   Irregular, broad, ribbon-like appearance.
    *   **Medically Important Examples:** Mucorales order (e.g., *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*), which cause mucormycosis. These hyphae often show wide-angle, irregular branching.

# 3. Dimorphic Fungi
*   **Definition:** Fungi that exist as either mold or yeast depending on the temperature. This is a key virulence factor.
*   **Pathophysiology:** They are typically inhaled as mold spores from the environment and convert to the pathogenic yeast form in the warmer host tissues.
*   **Buzzword Mnemonic:** **"Mold in the Cold, Yeast in the Heat (Beast)"**
    *   **25°C (environment):** Mold form
    *   **37°C (in vivo/body temp):** Yeast form
*   **High-Yield Pathogens:**
    *   ***Histoplasma capsulatum***: Yeast form is small, often seen within macrophages.
    *   ***Blastomyces dermatitidis***: Yeast form is large with a single, **broad-based bud**.
    *   ***Coccidioides immitis***: Forms a **spherule** (not a true yeast) containing endospores at 37°C.
    *   ***Paracoccidioides brasiliensis***: Yeast form looks like a "captain's wheel" (multiple buds).
    *   ***Sporothrix schenckii***: Yeast form is cigar-shaped.

# 4. Asexual Spores (Conidia)
*   **Purpose:** Primarily for reproduction and dispersal.
*   **Sporangiospores:** Spores formed **internally** within a sac-like structure called a sporangium.
    *   **Example:** *Rhizopus* and *Mucor*.
*   **Conidia:** Spores borne **externally** on a specialized structure called a conidiophore.
    *   **Example:** *Aspergillus* (forms a "fruiting body"), *Penicillium*.
