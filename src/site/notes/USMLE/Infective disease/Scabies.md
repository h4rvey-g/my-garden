# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Highly contagious
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Transmission is via direct person-to-person contact</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The fertilized, female mite tunnels into the superficial skin layer ([[USMLE/MSK/Skin layers\|stratum corneum]]), forming burrows in which she lays her eggs and deposits feces (scybala).</span>
- After 2 months, the female parasite dies on site.
- Following a period of 3 weeks, the larvae mature into adult mites, maintaining the infestation cycle.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The excretions of the mites and their decomposing bodies contain antigens which cause an immunological response (see [[USMLE/Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction\|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]]), presenting as severe pruritus and excoriations. </span>

# Clinical features
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intense pruritus that increases at night</span>
	- The name "scabies" comes from "scratch"
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The warmth of the skin, especially under blankets and pajamas, can stimulate mite movement and activity, increasing pruritus.</span>
- Skin lesions
	- Burrows of 2â€“10 mm in length![Pasted image 20240409213629.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240409213629.png)
- Predilection sites 
	- Wrists (flexor surface)
	- Medial aspect of fingers
	- Interdigital folds (hands and feet)
	- Male genitalia (e.g., scrotum, penis)
	- All other intertriginous areas of the skin (anterior axillary fold, buttocks)

# Diagnostics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Detection of mites, larvae, ova, or mite feces</span>
	- Revealed in dermoscopy![Pasted image 20250404201428.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250404201428.png)
	- Microscopic examination of the skin 
	- Skin scraping and histology

# Treatment
---
- Drug of choice: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Infective disease/Ectoparasites\|permethrin]]</span> 5% lotion
- Alternatives
	- Oral ivermectin: especially indicated in large outbreaks or severe forms of scabies
