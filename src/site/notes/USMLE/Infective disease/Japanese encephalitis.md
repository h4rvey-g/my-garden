- **Pathophysiology/Etiology**
    - **Causative agent:** Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a single-stranded RNA **Flavivirus**.
    - **Transmission:** Transmitted by the bite of infected **Culex mosquitoes**, particularly *Culex tritaeniorhynchus*. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The main reservoirs are **pigs** and **wading birds**.</span>
    - **Mechanism:** Virus replicates locally, leading to viremia and potential invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroinvasive disease occurs when the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier. Humans are considered **dead-end hosts** as they don't develop sufficient viremia to transmit to mosquitoes.
    - **Risk:** Most common in rural, agricultural areas of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific, especially during rainy seasons.

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - **Incubation period:** 5-15 days.
    - **Asymptomatic:** >99% of infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild, nonspecific febrile illness.
    - **Symptomatic Disease (<1%):**
        - **Prodrome:** Abrupt onset of fever, headache, vomiting, and malaise.
        - **Encephalitis:** Altered mental status (disorientation, confusion, coma), [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]] (especially common in children), and focal neurologic deficits.
        - **Movement disorders:** A classic feature is a **Parkinsonian syndrome** with mask-like facies, [[USMLE/Neurology/Tremor\|tremor]], [[USMLE/MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity\|rigidity]], and choreoathetoid movements.
        - **Other:** Acute flaccid paralysis ([[USMLE/MSK/Poliomyelitis\|poliomyelitis]]-like), neck [[USMLE/MSK/Spasticity (Clonus) vs Rigidity\|rigidity]].

- **Diagnosis**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Gold Standard:** Detection of **JEV-specific IgM antibodies in [[USMLE/Neurology/Cerebrospinal fluid analysis\|CSF]]** is the most reliable method for diagnosis.</span>
    - **Serology:** JEV-specific IgM in serum can also be used. A four-fold rise in IgG titers between acute and convalescent sera is also diagnostic. Cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Dengue\|Dengue]], West Nile) can complicate interpretation.
    - **CSF Analysis:** Shows lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated protein and normal glucose, typical for viral encephalitis.
    - **Imaging:** MRI may show characteristic **bilateral thalamic lesions**, though this finding is not always present.
    - **PCR:** Limited utility on CSF or blood due to the short duration of viremia.

- **DDx (Differential Diagnosis)**
    - **Other viral encephalitides:** West Nile Virus, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) encephalitis (often shows temporal lobe involvement), enteroviruses.
    - **Bacterial [[USMLE/Infective disease/Meningitis\|meningitis]]:** Differentiated by CSF analysis (neutrophilic pleocytosis, low glucose).
    - **Cerebral [[USMLE/Infective disease/Malaria\|malaria]]:** In travelers from endemic regions, presents with fever and altered mental status.
    - **Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM):** Post-infectious/post-[[USMLE/Immunology/Vaccination\|vaccination]] demyelination.

- **Management/Treatment**
    - **No specific [[USMLE/Infective disease/Antiviral therapy\|antiviral therapy]]** exists for Japanese encephalitis.
    - **Supportive Care:** Treatment is focused on managing symptoms. This includes:
        - Hospitalization for close monitoring.
        - Managing [[USMLE/Neurology/Brain herniation\|elevated intracranial pressure]] (e.g., mannitol).
        - Controlling seizures with [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|anticonvulsants]].
        - Airway protection and respiratory support if needed.
        - Antipyretics ([[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|acetaminophen]] preferred over [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDs]] due to bleeding risk) and fluid management.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Prevention:** **[[USMLE/Immunology/Vaccination\|Vaccination]]** is the most effective preventive measure for travelers to endemic areas and for residents in high-risk regions.</span> The IXIARO vaccine is available in the US. Personal protective measures against mosquito bites are also crucial.

- **Key Associations/Complications**
    - **High mortality:** Case-fatality rate for those who develop encephalitis is approximately 20-30%.
    - **Severe neurologic sequelae:** 30-50% of survivors have long-term neurologic, cognitive, or psychiatric problems.
    - **Common sequelae:** Parkinsonism, seizure disorders, cognitive impairment, weakness/paralysis, and behavioral changes.
