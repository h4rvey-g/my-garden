# Clinical features
---
- Main symptoms: dermatomal distribution, typically affecting 1–3 dermatomes on one side of the body (most commonly affects the cervical, trigeminal, thoracic, and lumbar dermatomes) 
	- Pain 
		- The most frequent symptom and may precede the rash
		- Usually described as “burning”, “throbbing”, or “stabbing”
		- Allodynia may occur.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Erythematous maculopapular rash that quickly evolves into vesicular lesions </span>
		- Vesicles are initially clear.
		- Pustulation and rupture typically occur after 3 or 4 days.
		- Crusting and involution typically occurs between day 7 and 10. 
		- Lesions may become necrotic, generalized, or may not be present at all.
- Additional symptoms 
	- Fever, headache, and fatigue
# Subtypes and variants
---
## Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reactivation of VZV in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve</span>
- Clinical features 
	- Fever and skin symptoms as in shingles
	- Herpes zoster conjunctivitis
	- [[USMLE/MSK/Keratitis\|Herpes zoster keratitis]] 
	- Involvement of the ophthalmic nerve: reduced corneal sensitivity with severe pain in the innervated regions (forehead, bridge and tip of the nose)
	- Involvement of the nasociliary nerve: 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Possible severe intraocular infection (uveitis, iritis, conjunctivitis, [[USMLE/MSK/Keratitis\|keratitis]], and optic neuritis) </span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Positive Hutchinson sign of the nose: a vesicular rash on the nasal alae</span>
## Herpes zoster oticus
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Definition: reactivation of VZV in the geniculate ganglion, affecting the seventh (facial) and eighth (vestibulocochlear) cranial nerves (also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome)</span>
- Clinical features
	- Fever and skin symptoms as in shingles in the auditory canal and pinna (see “Clinical features” above) 
	- Vestibulocochlear nerve involvement → vertigo and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)
	- Facial nerve involvement → ipsilateral facial paralysis

# Treatment

# Complications
---
## Postherpetic neuralgia
- Definition: chronic neuropathic pain persisting for at least three months in the area previously affected by the rash
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Postherpetic neuralgia only happens in VZV, not other herpesviruses</span>
- Epidemiology 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common complication</span> (occurs in 10–20% of overall herpes zoster cases)
	- Strong association with age
- Risk factors 
	- Age > 50 years
	- Severe infection (severe pain or rash)
- Clinical features 
	- Pain (including allodynia, paresthesias, dysesthesias) in the same dermatome as the rash
	- Duration of symptoms > 3 months but can persist for years
- Treatment
	- One of the following <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tricyclic [[USMLE/Psychiatry/Antidepressants\|antidepressants]]</span>: 
		- Reduces <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">serotonin and norepinephrine</span> at the same time
		- Amitriptyline
		- Nortriptyline
		- Relative contraindications: patients with heart disease, [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|epilepsy]], or glaucoma
		- Should be used with caution in elderly patients
	- One of the following [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|anticonvulsants]]: 
		- Pregabalin
		- Gabapentin
	- Topical treatments 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Capsaicin patch or cream</span>
