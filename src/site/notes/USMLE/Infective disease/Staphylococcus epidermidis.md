- **Microbiology:**
    
    - Gram-positive cocci, typically in clusters.
    - Catalase-positive.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Coagulase-negative** (differentiates from _S. aureus_).</span>
    - Urease-positive.
    - **Novobiocin-sensitive** (differentiates from novobiocin-resistant _S. saprophyticus_).
- **Clinical Significance:**
    
    - Normal flora of the **skin**.
    - Common cause of opportunistic infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients or those with indwelling medical devices.
    - Key pathogen in infections of:
        - **Prosthetic devices:** Artificial heart valves (prosthetic valve endocarditis - PVE), prosthetic joints, shunts (e.g., ventriculoperitoneal shunts).
        - **Intravascular catheters** (central lines, IV catheters), leading to bacteremia and sepsis.
        - Less commonly, native valve endocarditis.
    - Frequently a **contaminant** of blood cultures due to its presence on the skin; clinical correlation is crucial.
- **Major Virulence Factor:**
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Biofilm formation:** Produces an extracellular polysaccharide slime layer (glycocalyx) that allows it to adhere strongly to foreign materials (plastics, metals) and protects it from host immune responses and antibiotics. This is critical for its pathogenesis on implanted devices.</span>![Pasted image 20250415084522.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250415084522.png)
- **Treatment:**
    
    - Often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including methicillin (Methicillin-Resistant _S. epidermidis_ - MRSE).
    - **Vancomycin** is typically the empiric drug of choice for serious infections.
    - Management often requires **removal of the infected foreign body/device** in addition to antibiotic therapy.
    - If susceptible, nafcillin or oxacillin can be used.
