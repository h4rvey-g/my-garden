- An obligate intracellular parasite
	- Tachyzoite: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">crescent shape</span> with a tapered anterior end and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a large nucleus set centrally</span>![Pasted image 20250503093920.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250503093920.png)
- Route of transmission
	- Oral ingestion: The oocysts are excreted in the feces of cats (final host) and are orally ingested by other mammals such as humans, hoofed animals, and birds (intermediate hosts). Primary modes of transmission include the following:
		- Cat feces
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Raw or insufficiently cooked meat (most common)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Unpasteurized milk (especially goat milk)</span>
	- Transplacental transmission: see toxoplasmosis in pregnancy
	- Via organ transplantation or blood transfusion

## Ocular toxoplasmosis
- Clinical features
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chorioretinitis</span>
		- Defects in the visual field at the site of inflammation
		- Pain
		- Optic atrophy or macular scar formation can progress to blindness.
- Diagnostics 
	- Fundoscopy
		- Acute toxoplasmosis 
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Yellow-white retinal lesion  </span>
			- Marked vitreous reaction
			- Concomitant [[USMLE/MSK/Vasculitides\|vasculitis]]

# Diagnostics

- Imaging: CT or MRI with contrast 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple ring-enhancing lesions (brain abscesses)</span>![highresdefault_L25958.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L25958.jpg)
	- Lesions located predominantly in the [[USMLE/Neurology/Basal ganglia\|basal ganglia]] and/or the subcortical white matter
