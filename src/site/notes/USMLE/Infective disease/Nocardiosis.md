- Pathogen: Nocardia species (ubiquitous in soil worldwide)
	- Reservoir: soil
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gram positive with branching filaments</span>
	- Aerobe
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weakly acid-fast staining</span> (Ziehl-Neelsen stain)![Pasted image 20241201153850.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020241201153850.png)
	- Catalase positive
- Risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immunocompromise</span> (e.g., due to [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV infection]], organ transplant, glucocorticoid therapy, recent chemotherapy, [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]])

# Clinical features

## Pulmonary nocardiosis
- Risk group: immunocompromised individuals
- Clinical features
	- Constitutional: fever, weight loss, anorexia, night sweats
	- Respiratory (recurrent [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]]): productive cough, [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|dyspnea]], pleuritic chest pain
	- Pulmonary nocardiosis symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss are often mistaken for [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]]
