# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)
- Fecal-oral: eggs are ingested from contaminated water or vegetables

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Often asymptomatic
- Symptoms caused by cysticerci accumulation in subcutaneous tissue, muscles, brain, spinal cord, and eyes
	- Palpable subcutaneous cysts
	- Myalgia
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Neurocysticercosis (cysticerci-containing cysts in the CNS): increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, [[USMLE/Neurology/Seizures and epilepsy\|seizures]]</span>
	- Ocular cysticercosis: eye pain, loss of visual acuity or vision in one eye

# Diagnostics
---
- Initial test: CBC may show eosinophilia
- Additional testing
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Imaging: cerebral MRI/CT showing multiple, small (&lt; 1 cm) cystic lesions with a membranous wall and an invaginated scolex (“dot sign�? </span>
		- Viable cysts: round, hypodense ± scolex
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nonviable cysts: calcified nodules</span>![L64662.png](/img/user/appendix/L64662.png)
	- Lumbar puncture: �?protein, �?glucose, mononuclear pleocytosis 
	- Biopsy: Cysts with an invaginated scolex during earlier stages![Pasted image 20240307213812.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240307213812.png)
