## Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
### Adenocarcinoma
- Location: Peripheral
- Characteristics
	- Most common type of primary lung cancer
	- More common in women and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">nonsmokers</span>
	- Associated with mutations in:
		- EGFR gene
		- ALK gene
		- KRAS gene
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Common finding: hypertrophic osteoarthropathy ([[USMLE/Respiratory/Nail clubbing\|digital clubbing]])</span>
	- Most common type of lung cancer that originates in pulmonary scars 
	- Prognosis is usually better than in other types of lung cancer
 >[!note] 
 >“**A**denocarcinoma of **L**ung **K**inase”: Cancer (adenocarcinoma of lung) and the gene product (tyrosine kinase) are associated with ALK mutations.
## Lung neuroendocrine tumors

	- Early metastases
	- Poor prognosis
### Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
- Location: Peripheral

### Bronchial [[USMLE/Endocrine/Carcinoid tumor\|carcinoid tumor]]
- Location: Central or peripheral
	- A rare type of neuroendocrine lung tumor that consists predominantly of neuroendocrine Kulchitsky cells
- Neuroendocrine Kulchitsky cells
	- Rapid growth pattern
	- Expressed [[USMLE/Pathology/Tumor markers\|tumor markers]]
		- Chromogranin A
		- Synaptophysin
		- Neuron-specific enolase

## Variants of lung cancer
### [[USMLE/Neurology/Horner syndrome\|Pancoast tumor]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">An apical lung carcinoma</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Located in the superior sulcus of the lung (superior sulcus tumor) </span>
- Predominantly NSCLC 
- May lead to the development of Pancoast syndrome
	- Cervical sympathetic ganglion (stellate ganglion): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Horner syndrome\|Horner syndrome]] (ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis) </span>

# Diagnostics
## Microscopic
### Adenocarcinoma
![Pasted image 20230723153231.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230723153231.png)
composed of columnar cells that proliferate along the framework of alveolar septae, a so-called "lepidic" growth pattern.
### Squamous cell carcinoma
![Pasted image 20230723153407.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230723153407.png)
- pink cytoplasm
- keratin pearls
- distinct cell border
### Large cell carcinoma
![L77581.png](/img/user/appendix/L77581.png)
- Undifferentiated
- Large tumor cells
### Small cell carcinoma
![Pasted image 20231230144704.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231230144704.png)![L66016.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L66016.jpg)
This is the microscopic pattern of a small cell anaplastic (oat cell) carcinoma in which small dark blue cells with minimal cytoplasm are packed together in sheets.
### Hamartoma
![Pasted image 20230723155339.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230723155339.png)
composed mostly of benign cartilage on the right that is jumbled with a fibrovascular stroma and scattered bronchial glands on the left. A hamartoma is a neoplasm in an organ that is composed of tissue elements normally found at that site, but growing in a haphazard mass.
