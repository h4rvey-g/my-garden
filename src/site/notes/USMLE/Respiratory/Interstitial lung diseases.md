# Classifications of Interstitial Lung Diseases

Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung interstitium. Classification is based on etiology and histopathology.

## 1. ILDs of Known Cause

*   **Connective Tissue Disease-Associated ILD (CTD-ILD)**: Lung involvement is a common and serious complication of autoimmune diseases.
    *   **Examples**: Systemic Sclerosis (Scleroderma), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Sjögren's Syndrome, Polymyositis/Dermatomyositis (PM/DM), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).
    *   **Key Feature**: ILD may be the first manifestation of the underlying CTD.
    *   **Dx**: Requires autoimmune serologies (e.g., ANA, anti-Scl-70, RF, anti-CCP, anti-Jo-1).

*   **Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)**: Immune response to inhaled organic antigens.
    *   **Etiology**: Exposure to antigens like moldy hay (**Farmer's Lung**), bird droppings/feathers (**Bird Fancier's Lung**), or contaminated humidifiers.
    *   **Patho**: Can be a mix of Type III (immune complex) and Type IV (delayed, T-cell mediated) hypersensitivity reactions.
    *   **Presentation**:
        *   **Acute**: Flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnea) 4-8 hours post-exposure.
        *   **Chronic**: Progressive dyspnea and fibrosis with long-term, low-level exposure.
    *   **Dx**: History of exposure is key. Precipitating IgG antibodies to the offending antigen. HRCT may show ground-glass opacities and poorly formed, non-caseating granulomas.

*   **Drug-Induced ILD**:
    *   **Common culprits**: **Amiodarone**, **Bleomycin**, **Methotrexate**, **Nitrofurantoin**, Radiation therapy.

*   **Pneumoconioses (Occupational Exposures)**:
    *   **Asbestosis**: Shipbuilding, roofing, plumbing. Affects **lower lobes**. Associated with pleural plaques and ↑ risk of bronchogenic carcinoma & mesothelioma.
    *   **Silicosis**: Mining, sandblasting, quarrying. Affects **upper lobes**. Associated with "eggshell" calcification of hilar lymph nodes and ↑ risk of TB.
    *   **Berylliosis**: Aerospace, manufacturing. Mimics sarcoidosis with non-caseating granulomas.
    *   **Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis**: Coal mining. Affects **upper lobes**.

## 2. Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (IIPs)

This is a group of ILDs with no known cause, classified by specific histopathologic patterns.

*   **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)**
	- **Pathophysiology/Etiology**
	    - Chronic, progressive, fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause.
	    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Believed to result from recurrent alveolar epithelial cell injury in a susceptible individual, leading to an abnormal wound-healing response with excessive collagen deposition.</span>
	    - Risk factors: smoking, environmental exposures (metal/wood dust), certain viral infections, and genetic predisposition (e.g., telomerase mutations).
	
	- **Clinical Presentation**
	    - Insidious onset of progressive exertional **dyspnea** and a persistent **non-productive cough**, typically in males > 60 years old.
	    - Physical exam: **Fine "Velcro-like" inspiratory crackles** at the lung bases are characteristic. Digital **clubbing** is seen in ~50% of patients.
	    - Systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss can occur but are less common.
	
	- **Diagnosis**
	    - Requires exclusion of other causes of interstitial lung disease (e.g., connective tissue disease, drug toxicity, hypersensitivity pneumonitis).
	    - **High-Resolution CT (HRCT)** of the chest is the key imaging modality.
	        - **Typical Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP) pattern** on HRCT is diagnostic and includes:
	            - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Subpleural, basilar predominant** reticulation.</span>
	            - **Honeycombing** (clustered cystic airspaces), with or without traction bronchiectasis.![Pasted image 20250519113559.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250519113559.png)
	    - **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Show a **restrictive pattern** (↓ FVC, ↓ TLC, normal or ↑ FEV1/FVC ratio) and impaired gas exchange (↓ DLCO).
	    - **Surgical lung biopsy** is the gold standard if HRCT is not definitive, showing a histologic UIP pattern (patchy fibrosis, fibroblastic foci).![L67749.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L67749.jpg)

*   **Cryptogenic Organizing Pneumonia (COP)**
	- **Patho/Etiology**
	    - Idiopathic, non-infectious pneumonia characterized by intra-alveolar buds of granulation tissue (**Masson bodies**) in distal airways, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.![Pasted image 20240319210342.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240319210342.png)
	    - Represents a nonspecific response to alveolar epithelial injury. The underlying lung architecture is preserved.
	    - "Cryptogenic" implies no known cause. Organizing pneumonia (OP) can be secondary to infections, drugs (e.g., amiodarone), connective tissue diseases (e.g., RA, polymyositis), or radiation.
	
	- **Clinical Presentation**
	    - Typically affects patients in their 50s-60s.
	    - Subacute onset (weeks to months) of a flu-like illness that **fails to respond to antibiotics**.
	    - Key symptoms: persistent non-productive cough, dyspnea, fever, malaise, weight loss.
	    - Physical exam: inspiratory crackles ("Velcro rales") are common. Clubbing is characteristically **absent**.
	
	- **Diagnosis**
	    - **CXR:** Bilateral, patchy, peripheral alveolar opacities. Opacities can be migratory.
	    - **HRCT (High-Resolution CT):** Gold standard for imaging. Shows patchy airspace consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and nodules, often with a **peripheral/subpleural** or peribronchial distribution.
	    - **"Reversed halo sign" or "Atoll sign"** (central ground-glass opacity surrounded by a denser rim of consolidation) is highly specific but not very sensitive.
	    - **PFTs:** Usually show a **restrictive pattern**.
	    - **Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):** Shows a mixed inflammatory pattern with increased lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils. Helps to exclude infection.
	    - **Surgical Lung Biopsy (VATS):** Gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Histology reveals polypoid plugs of loose organizing connective tissue (Masson bodies) in the alveoli.

*   **Smoking-Related ILDs**
    *   **Respiratory Bronchiolitis-ILD (RB-ILD)** and **Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia (DIP)**: Both occur almost exclusively in smokers. Characterized by pigment-laden macrophages in respiratory bronchioles (RB-ILD) or alveolar spaces (DIP). Good prognosis with smoking cessation.

## 3. Granulomatous ILDs

*   **Sarcoidosis**: A multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by **non-caseating granulomas**.
# Pathophysiology
---
- General
	- All types of ILDs share the same basic pathophysiology.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Repeated cycles of tissue injury in the lung parenchyma with aberrant [[USMLE/Pathology/Wound healing\|wound healing]] → collagenous fibrosis → remodeling of the pulmonary interstitium</span>
- Pneumoconiosis: inhalation of dust particles → phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages → destruction of alveolar macrophages, inflammatory reaction → scarring, [[USMLE/Immunology/Granulomatous inflammation\|granuloma]] formation

# Clinical features
---


# Diagnostics
---
## High-resolution CT (HRCT) chest
- Typical UIP pattern findings 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Honeycombing: multiple cystic lesions within the lung parenchyma due to fibrosis</span>![Pasted image 20240319210817.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240319210817.png)
	- Irregular thickening of intralobular septa
	- Reticular pattern and mild ground glass opacity (GGO)
	- Traction [[USMLE/Respiratory/Bronchiectasis\|bronchiectasis]] (irreversible dilatation of the bronchi and bronchioles due to fibrosis)
## Pulmonary function tests ([[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary function testing\|PFTs]])
- Restrictive lung disease pattern 
	- ↓ Total lung capacity and ↓ vital capacity
	- Normal or ↓ FEV1
	- ↓ FVC
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Normal or ↑ FEV1:FVC ratio</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The increased elastic recoil results in increased radial traction (outward pulling) on the airways, leading to increased expiratory flow rates when corrected for the low lung volume.</span>
- Decreased diffusing capacity for CO ([[USMLE/Respiratory/DLCO\|DLCO]]): highly sensitive parameter
