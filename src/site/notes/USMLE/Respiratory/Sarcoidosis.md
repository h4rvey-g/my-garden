# Pathophysiology
Sarcoidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by widespread, immune-mediated formation of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">noncaseating granulomas</span>.
- General
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhalation of foreign antigen</span> �?monocyte differentiation �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">activation of interstitial dendritic cells and alveolar macrophages</span>
	- Interstitial dendritic cells migrate towards mediastinal lymph nodes and alveolar macrophages differentiate, serving as antigen-presenting cells to circulating T helper (Th) cells �?<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">differentiation and clonal expansion of T cells</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">T cell recruitment and �?B-cell activity �?local immune hyperactivity and inflammation �?formation of noncaseating granulomas in the lungs and the lymphatic system</span>
- [[USMLE/Immunology/Granulomatous inflammation\|Granuloma]] formation: Mature granulomas are composed of epithelioid cells and macrophages surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts.
	- Macrophages activate Th1 cells. 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Th1 cells stimulate the formation of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells by releasing IFN-γ.</span>![Pasted image 20240222102853.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240222102853.png)
	- Epithelioid cells produce angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and release cytokines that recruit more immune cells.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Asteroid bodies: star-shaped, eosinophilic inclusion bodies consisting of various lipids (e.g., from sarcoidosis, foreign body reactions)</span>![Pasted image 20230807213802.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230807213802.png)

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fibrosis</span>: Epithelioid cells secrete cytokines to recruit fibroblasts, leading to fibrosis �?damage of organs and tissue

# Clinical features
## Pulmonary sarcoidosis
- Lungs are the most commonly affected organ (90% of affected individuals).
- Often asymptomatic in the early stages
- Classic finding is hilar lymphadenopathy![Pasted image 20230803213638.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230803213638.png)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Interstitial fibrosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough, exertional dyspnea, chest pain</span>
	- Mild rales on pulmonary auscultation
## Extrapulmonary sarcoidosis

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lupus pernio</span>
	- A pathognomonic manifestation of sarcoidosis characterized by extensive, violaceous skin plaques (i.e., epithelioid granulomas of the dermis) on the nose, cheeks, chin, and/or ears 

Butterfly rash as seen in [[USMLE/Immunology/Systemic lupus erythematosus\|systemic lupus erythematosus]]
### Neurosarcoidosis
- Cranial nerve palsy (unilateral or bilateral <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">facial nerve palsy is the most common</span>)
- [[USMLE/Renal/Diabetes insipidus\|Diabetes insipidus]]
### Ocular sarcoidosis
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sarcoid uveitis</span> 
	- Most common ocular manifestation
	- Manifests with pain, redness, and photophobia

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>Increased ACE levels may be seen. However, they are not specific for sarcoidosis and should not be used in isolation for diagnosis or monitoring.

## Imaging
- Chest x-ray
	- Preferred initial test for all patients with suspected sarcoidosis
	- Classic findings: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">with or without pulmonary infiltrates</span> (i.e., reticular and/or <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ground glass opacities</span>)![Pasted image 20230803213638.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230803213638.png)![Pasted image 20240109153322.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240109153322.png)
