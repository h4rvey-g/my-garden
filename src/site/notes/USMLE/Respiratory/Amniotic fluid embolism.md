- Desquamated fetal cells or lanugo from amniotic fluid enter maternal circulation and embolize to the pulmonary arterioles, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">mechanically block the pulmonary arterioles</span> → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased pulmonary arterial pressure, right [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]], and pulmonary edema</span>
- Entry of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">procoagulants (thromboplastin) from amniotic fluid into maternal circulation → diffuse intravascular coagulation</span> 
- Entry of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leukotrienes from amniotic fluid into maternal circulation → triggering of an immune response → pulmonary vasospasm, alveolar capillary damage (pulmonary edema), and hypotension</span>
