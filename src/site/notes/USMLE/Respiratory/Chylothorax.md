- **Patho/Etiology:** Accumulation of chyle (lymphatic fluid from the intestines) in the pleural space due to disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct.
    
    - **Traumatic:** Most common overall cause. Often iatrogenic, secondary to thoracic surgery (e.g., esophagectomy, cardiac surgery) or chest trauma.![Pasted image 20250620171651.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250620171651.png)
    - **Non-traumatic:** Malignancy is the most frequent non-traumatic cause, especially **lymphoma**. Other causes include infections (e.g., TB, filariasis), sarcoidosis, cirrhosis, and superior vena cava (SVC) thrombosis.
- **Clinical Presentation:** Symptoms relate to the size and rate of fluid accumulation.
    
    - Progressive dyspnea is the most common symptom.
    - Cough, chest pressure.
    - Fever and sharp chest pain are typically absent.
    - Signs of pleural effusion on exam: decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion.
    - Post-traumatic chylothorax may present up to 10 days after the initial injury.
- **Diagnosis:**
    
    - **Thoracentesis (Gold Std):** Pleural fluid analysis is key.
        - **Appearance:** Milky, opalescent fluid is classic but only seen in about half of cases; can be serous or serosanguineous, especially in fasting patients.
        - **Biochemistry:** Definitive diagnosis relies on lipid analysis.
            - **Triglycerides > 110 mg/dL** (diagnostic).
            - Triglycerides 50-110 mg/dL is borderline; requires lipoprotein analysis to confirm **chylomicrons**.
            - Triglycerides < 50 mg/dL makes chylothorax unlikely.
            - Pleural fluid cholesterol to triglyceride ratio < 1.
    - **Imaging:** CXR shows pleural effusion. CT chest can help identify the underlying cause (e.g., mediastinal mass, trauma). Lymphangiography (conventional or MR) can localize the leak if needed for intervention.
- **DDx (of pleural effusion):**
    
    - **Pseudochylothorax:** Milky appearance but due to high cholesterol (>200 mg/dL) and cholesterol crystals, not triglycerides. Seen in chronic inflammatory effusions like TB or rheumatoid arthritis.
    - **Empyema:** Purulent fluid, high neutrophils, positive culture. Supernatant is clear after centrifugation, unlike chylothorax.
    - **Hemothorax:** Bloody fluid, Hct of fluid is >50% of serum Hct.
    - **Transudative vs. Exudative effusions:** Chylothorax is typically an exudate by Light's criteria.
- **Management/Treatment:**
    
    - **Conservative (First-line):** Goal is to decrease chyle flow.
        - Drainage of pleural fluid (thoracentesis or chest tube) for symptom relief.
        - Dietary modification: **Total parenteral nutrition (TPN)** or a low-fat diet with **medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)** supplementation (MCTs are absorbed directly into the portal system, bypassing lymphatics).
    - **Medical:** Octreotide/Somatostatin can reduce chyle flow.
    - **Invasive/Surgical:** Indicated for failure of conservative management, high-output fistulas (>1-1.5 L/day), or rapid nutritional decline.
        - **Thoracic duct ligation** (standard surgical approach).
        - **Thoracic duct embolization** (interventional radiology).
        - Pleurodesis (chemical or surgical).
- **Key Associations/Complications:**
    
    - **Complications:** Result from chronic loss of chyle.
        - **Malnutrition** and weight loss (loss of fats, proteins, fat-soluble vitamins).
        - **Immunosuppression** (loss of T-lymphocytes and immunoglobulins), leading to increased infection risk.
        - Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.
    - **Associations:** Lymphoma, Down syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome.
