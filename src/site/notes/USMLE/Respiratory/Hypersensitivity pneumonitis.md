# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
- Combined [[USMLE/Immunology/Type III hypersensitivity reactions\|type III hypersensitivity reaction]] and [[USMLE/Immunology/Type IV hypersensitivity reaction\|type IV hypersensitivity reaction]] with genetic predisposition
- Inhalation of organic particles (< 5 microns), primarily through occupational exposure
- Farmers are frequently affected

# Pathophysiology
---


# Clinical features
---
- Acute 
	- Flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, malaise, cough, headache
	- Dyspnea without wheezing
	- Chest tightness 
	- Diffuse fine crackles and a late inspiratory squawk  upon auscultation 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Symptoms subside within hours to days after removal of the inciting antigen.</span>
- Chronic 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Insidious onset of fatigue, productive cough, progressive dyspnea, cyanosis</span>
	- Bilateral rales
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Weight loss</span>
		- Due to increased respiratory activity

# Diagnostics
---
## High-resolution CT
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Honeycombing</span> (irreversible fibrotic changes) with or without emphysema
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Thickening of alveolar septa</span>
- Traction [[USMLE/Respiratory/Bronchiectasis\|bronchiectasis]] or bronchiolectasis
- Ground-glass opacities with inspiratory mosaic attenuation
## Additional studies
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): Lymphocytosis (e.g., ≥ 20–30%) is highly sensitive for HP.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary function testing: restrictive pattern</span>
- Lung biopsy
	- Supportive findings: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">noncaseating granulomas with lymphocytes and polynuclear giant cells</span>![Pasted image 20240321111432.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240321111432.png)

- Clinical features and HRCT: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vs [[USMLE/Respiratory/Interstitial lung diseases\|idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">IPF: Affected patients are usually older (eg, age >50) and granulomas are not expected on lung biopsy.</span>
