- **Pathophysiology/Etiology**
    - An imbalance between the amount of air reaching the alveoli (**V**entilation) and the amount of blood perfusing them (**Q**).
    - The ideal V/Q ratio is ~0.8 to 1.0. Any significant deviation impairs gas exchange, leading to **hypoxemia**.
    - An elevated A-a gradient is a hallmark of V/Q mismatch.

- **Two Extremes of V/Q Mismatch**
    - **1. Low V/Q (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Shunt</span>): Perfusion without Ventilation (V/Q → 0)**
        - **Mechanism:** Blood flows past alveoli that are not ventilated (e.g., collapsed or filled with fluid), so it cannot be oxygenated. This is called a **physiologic shunt**.
        - **Causes:** Airway obstruction (e.g., foreign body, mucus plug), pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis (lung collapse), ARDS.
        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Key Feature:** Hypoxemia that **does not correct** with 100% O2 because the supplemental O2 cannot reach the perfused capillaries.</span>
	        - In a healthy, ventilated alveolus, hemoglobin passing by is already ~97-98% saturated with oxygen even on room air (21% O2). 
	        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Only part of the blood redirect to healthy lungs, thus 100% O2 can't entirely fix.</span>

    - **2. High V/Q (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dead Space</span>): Ventilation without Perfusion (V/Q → ∞)**
        - **Mechanism:** Alveoli are ventilated, but there is no blood flow to them for gas exchange to occur. This is called **alveolar dead space**.
        - **Causes:** Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the classic cause. Others include emphysema (capillary destruction), and conditions with low cardiac output or pulmonary hypertension.
        - **Key Feature:** Primarily impairs **CO2 elimination**, leading to "wasted ventilation." Hypoxemia occurs and typically **corrects** with 100% O2.
	        - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Because all obstructed blood redirect to healthy arteries.</span>

- **Clinical Presentation**
    - **Hypoxemia** is the primary consequence.
    - Symptoms depend on the underlying cause but can include dyspnea, tachypnea, dizziness, and cyanosis.

- **Diagnosis**
    - **Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):** Shows hypoxemia (↓ PaO2).
    - **A-a Gradient:** **Increased** A-a gradient is a key finding in V/Q mismatch, distinguishing it from hypoxemia due to hypoventilation or low inspired O2 (which have a normal A-a gradient).
    - **V/Q Scan:** A nuclear medicine scan that directly measures and compares the distribution of ventilation and perfusion in the lungs. Classically used to diagnose PE.
    - **Imaging (CXR, CT):** Helps identify the underlying cause (e.g., pneumonia, edema, PE).

- **Management/Treatment**
    - **Treat the underlying cause:** This is the most crucial step (e.g., antibiotics for pneumonia, anticoagulation for PE, bronchodilators for asthma).
    - **Supplemental O2:** Effective for high V/Q dead space but poorly effective for low V/Q shunts.
    - **Mechanical Ventilation:** May be required for severe respiratory distress, often with PEEP to recruit collapsed alveoli in cases of shunting (e.g., ARDS).

- **Key Differentiating Factors (High-Yield)**
    - **Hypoxemia Correction with 100% O2:**
        - **Corrects:** Dead Space (e.g., PE).
        - **Does NOT correct:** Shunt (e.g., pneumonia, pulmonary edema).
    - **A-a Gradient:**
        - **Increased:** V/Q Mismatch, Shunt, Diffusion limitation.
        - **Normal:** Hypoventilation, High Altitude.
