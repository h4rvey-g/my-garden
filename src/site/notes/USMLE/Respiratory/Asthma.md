# Etiology
---
- Risk factors for asthma include:
    - Family history of asthma
    - Past history of allergies
    - [[USMLE/MSK/Atopic dermatitis\|Atopic dermatitis]]
    - Low socioeconomic status
- Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma) vs Nonallergic asthma (intrinsic asthma)
	- Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cardinal risk factor: [[USMLE/Respiratory/Atopy\|atopy]]</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Environmental allergens: pollen (seasonal), dust mites, domestic animals, mold spores</span>
		- Allergic occupational asthma from exposure to allergens in the workplace (e.g., flour dust)
	- Nonallergic asthma (intrinsic asthma)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Viral respiratory tract infections (one of the most common stimuli, especially in children)</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cold air</span>
		- Physical exertion (laughter, exercise-induced asthma)
		- [[USMLE/GI/Gastroesophageal reflux disease\|Gastroesophageal reflux disease]] ([[USMLE/GI/Gastroesophageal reflux disease\|GERD]]): often exists concurrently with asthma
		- Chronic [[USMLE/Respiratory/Sinusitis\|sinusitis]] or rhinitis
		- Medication: aspirin/[[USMLE/Pharmacology/Non-opioid analgesics\|NSAIDS]] (aspirin-induced asthma), [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|beta blockers]]
		- Stress
		- Irritant-induced occupational asthma (e.g., from exposure to solvents, ozone, tobacco or wood smoke, cleaning agents)

>[!tip] 
> - Allergic asthma (extrinsic asthma): A type of asthma triggered by allergens (e.g., pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet allergens). Typically onset in childhood.
> - Nonallergic asthma (intrinsic asthma): A type of asthma that typically develops in patients > 40 years of age.

# Pathophysiology
---
### Common underlying pathophysiology
![L41542.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L41542.jpg)
Asthma is an inflammatory disease <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">driven by T-helper type 2 cells (Th2-cell)</span> that manifests in individuals with a genetic predisposition. It consists of the following three pathophysiologic processes:
1. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness
2. Bronchial inflammation
	- Symptoms are primarily caused by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">inflammation of the terminal bronchioles, which are lined with smooth muscle but lack the cartilage found in larger airways.</span>
1. Endobronchial obstruction caused by:
	- Increased parasympathetic tone
		- Reversible bronchospasm
		- Increased mucus production
		- Mucosal edema and leukocyte infiltration into the mucosa with hyperplasia of goblet cells
	- Hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells
### Type-specific pathophysiology
- Allergic asthma
	- IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity to a specific allergen
	- Characterized by mast cell degranulation and release of histamine after a prior phase of sensitization
- Nonallergic asthma
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Irritant asthma: irritant enters lung �?�?release of neutrophils �?submucosal edema �?airway obstruction</span>
	- Aspirin-induced asthma (NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease) is characterized by the Samter triad:
		- Inhibition of COX-1 �?�?PGE2  �?�?leukotrienes and inflammation �?submucosal edema �?airway obstruction
		- Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis
		- Asthma symptoms

# Diagnostics
## Spirometry
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Supportive findings: Expiratory airway limitation: i.e., �?FEV1 and �?FEV1/FVC ratio</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchodilator Responsiveness Testing</span>:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Used when the patient has abnormal baseline spirometry showing obstruction (FEV1/FVC �?0%)</span>
	- Tests if the obstruction is reversible (suggesting asthma) or fixed (suggesting conditions like [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]])
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Not useful if current spirometry is normal</span>, even if the patient has asthma symptoms
	- Quick test: perform spirometry �?give bronchodilator �?repeat spirometry
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchial Challenge Testing</span>:
	- Identify airway hyperresponsiveness and bronchoconstriction <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">in response to direct, nonallergic stimuli (e.g., methacholine, histamine) or indirect stimuli (e.g., exercise, hyperventilation).</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Used when patient has symptoms suggestive of asthma but normal baseline spirometry</span>
	- Tests for airway hyperresponsiveness by attempting to provoke bronchospasm
	- Particularly useful for patients with intermittent symptoms who are <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">asymptomatic during office visits</span>
	- More time-intensive: involves giving increasing doses of the provocative agent and measuring response
