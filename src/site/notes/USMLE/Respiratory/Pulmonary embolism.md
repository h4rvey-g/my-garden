# Etiology
---
- Most common: Deep vein thrombosis 
- Causes of nonthrombotic embolism
	- Fat embolism
	- Air embolism
	- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Amniotic fluid embolism\|Amniotic fluid embolism]]
	- Bacterial embolism
		- Patients with intravenous drug use are at increased risk of developing <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">tricuspid valve endocarditis, giving rise to septic pulmonary emboli</span>
	- Others: pulmonary tumor embolism, pulmonary cement embolism

>[!tip] 
>Up to 30% of cases may present with no apparent risk factors (eg, hypercoagulability).

# Pathophysiology
---
![L26143.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L26143.jpg)
- The lung is supplied by <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">dual circulation from both the pulmonary arteries and bronchial arteries.</span> This collateral circulation can help protect against lung infarction as a complication of pulmonary embolism (PE).
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Distal PEs in small arteries (≤3 mm) are more likely to cause infarction</span> as they may occlude areas distal to the pulmonary-bronchial anastomoses.  
- When a pulmonary infarction does occur, it is typically hemorrhagic (red) rather than ischemic (white) due to the relatively low density of lung tissue and the dual blood supply.
# Clinical features
---
- Common features of PE
	- Acute onset of symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dyspnea (> 75% of cases)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tachycardia and tachypnea (up to 50% of cases)</span> 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden pleuritic chest pain (∼ 20% of cases) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cough and hemoptysis</span>
	- Associated features of DVT: e.g., unilaterally painful leg swelling
- Features of massive PE (e.g., due to a saddle thrombus)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Presyncope or syncope</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Jugular venous distension</span> and Kussmaul sign
		- RV pressure overload
	- Hypotension and obstructive shock
	- Circulatory collapse
# Diagnostics
---
## Confirmatory imaging
### CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA)
CTPA is the preferred test for the diagnosis of acute PE.
- Findings
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct finding of PE: intraluminal filling defects of pulmonary arteries </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary infarct: opacity with consolidated border</span>; may be accompanied by pleural effusion
## Severity assessment
### ECG
ECG changes may be due to right ventricular strain and pressure overload.
Most common findings 
- T-wave inversions or flattening
- Sinus tachycardia 
- Normal ECG
- S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub> pattern (neither sensitive nor specific)![Pasted image 20230808202409.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230808202409.png)
Predictors of adverse outcomes: See “High-risk ECG findings in PE.”
Other ECG findings in PE: sinus bradycardia (< 60/min); uncommon) 
# Treatment
---
## Reperfusion therapy
- Indications
	- Massive PE (hemodynamic instability and/or right [[USMLE/Cardiology/Heart failure\|heart failure]]) with a low bleeding risk
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), e.g., alteplase (preferred)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Endothelial-derived TPA is limited primarily to the bronchial circulation, and spontaneous recanalization of the pulmonary artery is a slow process.</span>
