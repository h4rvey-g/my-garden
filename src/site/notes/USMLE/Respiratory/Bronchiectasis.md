# Etiology
>[!tip] 
>
> Bronchiectasis requires the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">combination of two important processes</span> taking place in the bronchi: 
> - either <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">local infection</span> 
> - or<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> inflammation along with either inadequate clearance of secretions, airway obstruction, or impaired host defenses</span>. 
> 
> These processes result in the permanent dilation of airways.
- Pulmonary infections (i.e., bacterial, viral, fungal), especially severe or chronic infections 
- Disorders of secretion clearance or mucous plugging
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|Cystic fibrosis]] ([[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|CF]])  (Most common congenital cause of bronchiectasis)
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Primary ciliary dyskinesia\|Primary ciliary dyskinesia]] (PCD)
	- Allergic bronchopulmonary [[USMLE/Respiratory/Aspergillosis\|aspergillosis]] (ABPA)
	- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Primary ciliary dyskinesia\|Kartagener syndrome]]
	- Smoking: associated with poor ciliary motility
- Bronchial narrowing or other forms of obstruction
	- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]]
	- Aspiration
	- Tumors
- [[USMLE/Immunology/Congenital immunodeficiency disorders\|Immunodeficiency]] (e.g., common variable [[USMLE/Immunology/Congenital immunodeficiency disorders\|immunodeficiency]], hypogammaglobulinemia, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Human immunodeficiency virus\|HIV]])

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- Chronic productive cough (lasting months to years) with copious mucop<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"></span>urulent sputum
	- The sputum may be green or yellow in color.
- Auscultation
	- Crackles and rhonchi
	- Wheezing
- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|Dyspnea]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hemoptysis: usually mild or self-limiting, but severe hemorrhage that requires embolization may occur</span>
	- Results from the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">rupture of dilated bronchial wall vessels</span> (not pulmonary vessels)
	- Chronic and recurrent airway inflammation and infection stimulates <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">neovascularization and bronchial artery hypertrophy.</span>  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The dilated, fragile, and tortuous vessels are in close proximity to the bronchioles and prone to rupture with increased airway pressure, such as during coughing</span> (eg, acute pulmonary exacerbation).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Although bleeding from the low-pressure pulmonary circulation is more common, hemorrhage from the high-pressure, systemic bronchial circulation is usually responsible for massive, life-threatening hemoptysis.</span>![L26143.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L26143.jpg)
- Exacerbations of bronchiectasis
    - Recurrent bouts of [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]] and acute bacterial infection of sections of dilated bronchi
    - Frequently due to [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pseudomonas\|Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
    - Features
        - Increased production of mucous above baseline
        - Low-grade fever

> [!NOTE] Note
> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bronchiectasis should be suspected in patients with a chronic cough that produces large amounts of sputum.</span>

# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>In patients with suspected bronchiectasis, diagnosis is confirmed using imaging studies, preferably a HRCT scan. Additional diagnostic studies are useful to identify the underlying cause and possibly provide specific treatment.
## Imaging
High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest: confirmatory test
- Bronchial dilation
	- **Cylindrical or tubular (most common) : parallel tram track sign and signet ring sign**  ![Pasted image 20230804144028.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020230804144028.png)
	- Varicose 
	- Saccular or cystic (most severe form) 
	- Bronchial dilation can be identified with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">bronchial/arterial ratio > 1</span> (normally < 1)![Pasted image 20250403104958.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250403104958.png)
- Thickened bronchial walls, mucus plugging, honeycombing (suggests late-stage bronchiectasis)

---
# Treatment
## General measures
- Smoking cessation
- Bronchopulmonary hygiene and chest physiotherapy: e.g., cupping and clapping, postural drainage, directed cough, hydration
- Administer vaccinations (i.e., seasonal [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|influenza]] vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine).
