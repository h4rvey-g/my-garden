Syndromes characterized by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">progressive accumulation of surfactant protein in the alveoli</span>.
# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---
Autoimmunity

# Pathophysiology
---
Progressive surfactant accumulation in the alveoli interferes with gas exchange.

# Clinical features
---
- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|Dyspnea]]
- Cough (dry or productive), hemoptysis
- Cyanosis
- Weight loss, fatigue, malaise

# Diagnostics
---
- X-ray/CT chest shows a characteristic pattern of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ground-glass opacity and reticular densities (crazy-paving pattern)</span>
- Histopathologic findings would include granular, proteinaceous material within the alveoli with normal alveolar architecture.![Pasted image 20250127153652.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250127153652.png)
