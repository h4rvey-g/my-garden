# Pathophysiology
- Obstruction of the upper airways → apnea → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), ↑ partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>, also known as hypercapnia)</span>, which leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction → ↑ [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|pulmonary hypertension]] → [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|cor pulmonale]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Sympathetic activity → secondary hypertension</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Respiratory acidosis → renal compensation → increased HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> retention and decreased chloride reabsorption </span>

# Clinical features
- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|Pulmonary hypertension]] and [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pulmonary hypertension\|cor pulmonale]]
	- edema

---
# Diagnostics
>[!tip] 
>In OSA, hypercapnia is usually absent when the patient is awake. This fact explains why<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> arterial blood gases would be mostly normal in a patient with OSA</span>. Therefore, this test is not useful for diagnosis.

# Treatment
## Upper airway modification
- Description: surgical dilatation of the upper airway or neurostimulation of upper airway muscles
- Procedures 
	- Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty: resection of the uvula and redundant retrolingual, soft palate, and tonsillar tissue 
	- Other procedures include <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypoglossal nerve stimulation</span>, radiofrequency ablation of tongue and/or soft palate tissue, and palatal implants.
