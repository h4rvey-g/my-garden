# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Premature birth</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Reproductive/Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy\|Maternal diabetes]] mellitus: leads to ↑ fetal insulin, which inhibits surfactant synthesis</span>
- Hereditary
- Cesarean delivery: results in lower levels of fetal glucocorticoids than vaginal delivery, in which higher levels are released as a response to stress from uterine contractions 
- Hydrops fetalis
- Multifetal pregnancies
- Male sex

# Pathophysiology
## Surfactant deficiency
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Little or no reduction of alveolar surface tension → increased alveolar collapse → [[USMLE/Respiratory/Atelectasis\|atelectasis]] → decreased lung compliance and functional residual capacity → hypoxemia and hypercapnia</span>

---
# Clinical features
- Maternal history of premature birth
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Onset of symptoms: usually immediately after birth but can occur up to 72 hours postpartum</span>
- Signs of increased respiratory effort
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Tachypnea</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nasal flaring and moderate to severe subcostal/intercostal and jugular retractions </span>
- Characteristic expiratory grunting 
- Decreased breath sounds on auscultation
- Cyanosis due to pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction

# Diagnostics
---
- X-ray chest![L57477.png](/img/user/appendix/L57477.png)
	- Interstitial pulmonary edema with perihilar streaking
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Diffuse, fine, reticulogranular (ground-glass) densities with low lung volumes and air bronchograms</span> 
	- Atelectasis
# Complications
---
## Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chronic lung condition secondary to prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy for NRDS</span>
- Etiology: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pulmonary barotrauma and oxygen toxicity with subsequent inflammation of lung tissue due to ventilation of the immature lung </span>(ventilation for more than 28 days)
- Clinical features
	- Seen in infants < 32 weeks
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Persistence of symptoms similar to NRDS (e.g., tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring)</span>
	- Episodes of desaturation
- Diagnostics
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">X-ray chest: diffuse, fine, granular densities, areas of [[USMLE/Respiratory/Atelectasis\|atelectasis]] interspersed with areas of hyperinflation</span>
	- Blood gas analysis: respiratory and metabolic acidosis
	- Histology: [[USMLE/Respiratory/Atelectasis\|atelectasis]], fibrosis, emphysematous alveolar changes (decreased number and septation of alveoli)
- Treatment: controlled oxygenation, diuretics, rarely glucocorticoids
