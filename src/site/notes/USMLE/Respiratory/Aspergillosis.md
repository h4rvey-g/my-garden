# Definition
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): a hypersensitivity reaction caused by exposure to Aspergillus that mostly occurs in patients with [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|cystic fibrosis]] or [[USMLE/Respiratory/Asthma\|asthma]]</span>
- Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis: a long-term Aspergillus infection of the lung which can manifest as:
	- Aspergilloma: an opportunistic infection of a pre-existing cavitary lesion (e.g. from previous [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]])
	- Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis: a subacute and semi-invasive form of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis characterized by localized, slowly progressive, inflammatory destruction of lung tissue and commonly associated with [[USMLE/GI/Alcohol use disorder\|alcohol use disorder]]
- Invasive aspergillosis: a severe form of Aspergillus infection which manifests with severe [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]] and septicemia with potential involvement of other organs (e.g., skin, CNS) and mostly occurs in immunocompromised individuals
