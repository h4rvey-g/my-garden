# Epidemiology
- Peak incidence: 6 months to 3 years
- Most common in fall and winter
	- Viral infections are more likely to be acquired and transmitted in cold temperatures and dry air

---
# Etiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common pathogen: parainfluenza viruses (75% of cases)</span>
- Other pathogens: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|influenza]] virus

---
# Pathophysiology
Viral infection → inflammation of the upper airway with edema formation and infiltration of inflammatory cells → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">narrowing of subglottic airway</span> (inspiratory stridor) and increased [[USMLE/Respiratory/Work of breathing\|work of breathing]]![Pasted image 20231225203056.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231225203056.png)

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prodromal phase: 1–2 days of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (rhinitis, low-grade fever, sore throat)</span>
- Symptoms of croup last 2–7 days and typically manifest in the late evening/night.
- Characteristic features include<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> seal-like barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor due to subglottic narrowing.</span><iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qbn1Zw5CTbA" title="baby with Croup Stridor Barking Cough visual &amp; audio sound - When to Hospitalize." frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

# Diagnostics
## Imaging
- X-ray chest and neck (anteroposterior and lateral)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">May identify subglottic narrowing on anteroposterior view (steeple sign)</span>![Pasted image 20231101094014.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231101094014.png)![Pasted image 20231101094019.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231101094019.png)![Pasted image 20231101094259.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020231101094259.png)

| Difficulty swallowing/drooling     | Absent                                             | Present                                                          | Depends                                                         |
| X-ray neck and chest findings	<br> | Steeple sign (subglottic narrowing on chest x-ray) | Thumbprint sign (thickening of epiglottis on lateral neck x-ray) | Most FB are radiolucent                                         |
- **Croup (Subglottic Laryngitis/Laryngotracheitis):**
    - **Location:** Inflammation occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">_below_ the vocal cords</span>, in the larynx and trachea (subglottic region).
    - **Voice:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The swelling involves the vocal cords themselves, causing them to vibrate improperly, resulting in a **hoarse** voice.</span>
    - **Cough:** Inflammation and narrowing in the trachea lead to a characteristic **barking** cough, often described as seal-like.
- **Epiglottitis (Supraglottic Laryngitis):**
    - **Location:** Inflammation occurs <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">_above_ the vocal cords</span>, mainly involving the epiglottis (supraglottic region).
    - **Voice:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The vocal cords are not the primary site of swelling, but the severely swollen epiglottis obstructs the sound coming from the larynx, resulting in a **muffled** voice, sometimes called a "hot potato" voice.</span>
    - **Cough:** Cough is typically **absent** in epiglottitis. The inflammation is higher up, and the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">intense swelling and pain may suppress the cough reflex</span>. The primary concern is rapid airway obstruction rather than irritation causing a cough.
	    - Cough reflex: mediated by vagus nerve <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(cough receptors in trachea and large and medium diameter bronchi)</span>
