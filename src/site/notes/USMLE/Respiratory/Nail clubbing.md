- Pathophysiology
	- Clubbing is observed in cardiopulmonary disease states where <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hypoxic-inflammatory pathways are activated, releasing platelet and fibroblast-derived growth factors (especially VEGF)</span> that promote platelet clumping/embedment in the distal capillary beds (fingers, toes), which then leads to local fibrovascular proliferation.
- Associated conditions
	- Respiratory conditions, such as:
		- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Interstitial lung diseases\|Interstitial lung disease]]
		- [[USMLE/Respiratory/Interstitial lung diseases\|Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis]]
		- [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Cystic fibrosis\|Cystic fibrosis]] 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Respiratory/Lung cancer\|Lung cancer]]</span>
	- Cardiovascular conditions, such as:
		- Cyanotic congenital heart disease
		- Cardiac shunts
	- Infections, such as:
		- [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|Tuberculosis]]
		- Infections causing lung abscesses
	- Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy: a syndrome (either hereditary or paraneoplastic) that manifests with painful nail clubbing, synovial effusions, and periostitis 
	- IBD
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Not associated with [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]], [[USMLE/Respiratory/Asthma\|asthma]]</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">COPD per se does not cause clubbing, but if clubbing is present in COPD, underlying lung cancer and bronchiectasis must be ruled out.</span>
