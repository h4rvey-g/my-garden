# Pharmacodynamics
---
- Exogenous supply of nitric oxide (NO) through nitrate → activation of guanylyl cyclase → ↑ cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) → activation of protein kinase G
	- Increases SERCA activity → ↓ intracellular calcium → ↓ recruitment of contractile units → vasodilation
	- Increases myosin light chain phosphatase activity → ↓ phosphorylated myosin → smooth muscle relaxation → vasodilation
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral vasodilation</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Major contributor to [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|angina]] relief</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased preload through venous dilation (venous pooling) → reduces myocardial wall tension → improved myocardial perfusion</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Decreased afterload → reduces contraction effort → ↓ myocardial oxygen demand</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Greater vasodilatory effect on veins than arteries (except for [[USMLE/Blood/Cyanide poisoning\|sodium nitroprusside]])</span> 
		- Coronary dilation → improved myocardial perfusion 
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">In patients with atherosclerotic [[USMLE/Cardiology/Coronary artery disease\|CAD]], arterioles are already dilated to maximize cardiac blood flow (due to flow-limiting stenosis) → difficult to dilate coronary vessels further → limited effect of nitrates</span>
- Anginal pain relief: ↓ preload through venous pooling → ↓ heart size → ↓ oxygen demand → ↓ pain
# Adverse effects
---
- Circulatory dysregulation: hypotension, reflex sympathetic activity → reflex tachycardia → nitrate syncope
	- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Beta blockers\|Beta blockers]] can be applied to counter this mechanism
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nitrate-induced headache (due to the dilation of the cerebral arteries)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Development of tolerance</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prevention: intermittent therapy with nitrate-free intervals of at least 8 hours</span>
	- Usually the nitrate-free period is timed to occur during the night when the patient is sleeping and cardiac work is the least.
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cyanide toxicity after [[USMLE/Blood/Cyanide poisoning\|sodium nitroprusside]] infusion (see [[USMLE/Blood/Cyanide poisoning\|cyanide poisoning]])</span>
