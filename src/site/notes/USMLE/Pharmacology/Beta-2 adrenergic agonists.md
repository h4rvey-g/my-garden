# Pharmacodynamics
---
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibit mast cell degranulation</span>: act on β2-adrenergic receptors on mast cells. This interaction increases intracellular cAMP levels. The elevated cAMP levels activate the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, suppressing IgE/antigen-dependent signaling and reducing calcium influx, which is essential for degranulation. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Related to using epinephrine on anaphylaxis.</span>
- Types
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Long-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, salmeterol, formoterol)</span> are typically used for maintenance therapy in [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]] or with inhaled [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|corticosteroids]] in [[USMLE/Respiratory/Asthma\|asthma]].  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">These drugs have a lipophilic side chain, which allows them to attach to the plasma membrane and diffuse laterally across to the beta-2 receptor.  As a result, they have an extended duration of action (≥12 hours) but slow onset of action.</span>  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Salmeterol has a slightly longer duration of action than formoterol due to its ability to bind a secondary exosite within the beta-2 receptor, which serves as an anchor to prevent active site dissociation.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Short-acting beta-2 agonists (eg, albuterol, levalbuterol)</span> are typically used for acute symptom relief.  These drugs are relatively <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hydrophilic, interact minimally with the plasma membrane, and are rapidly metabolized</span>, explaining their rapid onset (minutes) and short duration of action (4-6 hours)
# Adverse effects
- Cardiac: ventricular arrhythmias, tachycardia
- Central nervous system/muscular: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Tremor\|tremor]]</span>
- Electrolytes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hyperglycemia</span> 
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">β2-mediated stimulation in the liver → elevated cAMP levels → increased glycogenolysis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Hypokalemia\|Hypokalemia]] (risk of life-threatening arrhythmias): β2-mediated stimulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase → intracellular K<sup>+</sup> shift </span>
