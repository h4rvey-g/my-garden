>- Skeletal muscle: opening of voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) in the T tubules and the mechanically coupled ryanodine receptors (RYR) in the SR → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">SR releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the sarcoplasm</span> (buffered by calsequestrin) → increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>

>- Smooth muscle: stimulus opens L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in the sarcolemma  → influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the extracellular space into the smooth muscle cell (Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also released from the SR, further increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
>- Cardiac muscle: AP originating from the cardiac pacemaker cells → muscle cell depolarization that diffuses across the sarcolemma and into T-tubules → short, rapid influx of sodium; prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR</span>  → increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>

# Adverse effects
## Dihydropyridines
- Effects due to vasodilation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Peripheral edema (esp. amlodipine):  can be reduced by adding a renin-angiotensin system antagonist (ACEI or ARB).</span>
		- Development of peripheral edema is related to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">preferential dilation of precapillary vessels (arteriolar dilation)</span>, which leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased capillary hydrostatic pressure and fluid extravasation</span> into the interstitium.  
		- ACEI/ARB can cause postcapillary venodilation and can normalize the increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, reducing the risk of peripheral edema in patients taking calcium channel blockers.
	- Headaches, dizziness
	- Facial flushing, feeling of warmth
	- Reflex tachycardia
- Gingival hyperplasia
## Nondihydropyridines
- Reduced contractility
	- Verapamil decreases the amount of intracellular calcium available for excitation-contraction coupling within cardiac myocytes.  This reduces myocardial contractility, which can be harmful in patients with impaired ventricular function.
