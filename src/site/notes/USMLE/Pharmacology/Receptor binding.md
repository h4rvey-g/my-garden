| AGONIST WITH                      | POTENCY     | EFFICACY    | REMARKS                                                                                                         | EXAMPLE                                                                                 |

| **(A) Competitive antagonist**    | ↓           | No change   | Can be overcome by ↑ agonist concentration                                                                      | Diazepam (agonist) + flumazenil (competitive antagonist) on GABAₐ receptor.             |
| **(B) Noncompetitive antagonist** | No change   | ↓           | Cannot be overcome by ↑ agonist concentration                                                                   | Norepinephrine (agonist) + phenoxybenzamine (noncompetitive antagonist) on α-receptors. |
| **(C) Partial agonist (alone)**   | Independent | ↓           | Acts at same site as full agonist                                                                               | Morphine (full agonist) vs buprenorphine (partial agonist) at opioid μ-receptors.       |
| **Inverse agonist (alone)**       | Independent | Independent | Binds to a constitutively active receptor, thereby reducing its activity; has the opposite effect of an agonist | H₁ antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine)                                                 |
