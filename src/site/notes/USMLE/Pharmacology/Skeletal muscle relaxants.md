# Depolarizing NMJ blockers (depolarizing muscle relaxants)
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fast onset, short duration</span>
## Agents
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Succinylcholine (suxamethonium)</span>
# Indications
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anesthesia induction (esp. rapid sequence induction)</span>
## Monitoring
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Train-of-four stimulation shows an equal decrease in the amplitude of all 4 muscle twitches.</span>
	- The muscle fiber becomes unresponsive to any further stimulation![L10321.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L10321.jpg)
## Adverse effects
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Cardiology/Hyperkalemia\|Hyperkalemia]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mechanism: depolarization of large muscle groups → efflux of potassium ions into the extracellular space</span>
	- Succinylcholine is contraindicated in case of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hyperkalemia\|hyperkalemia]] or in conditions associated with a high-risk of [[USMLE/Cardiology/Hyperkalemia\|hyperkalemia]], including: 
		- Burn injuries
		- [[USMLE/Renal/Rhabdomyolysis and crush syndrome\|Rhabdomyolysis]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prolonged muscle paralysis, respiratory depression</span> and/or apnea in patients with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">congenital deficiency of plasma cholinesterase</span>
	- **AChE ("True Cholinesterase"):**
	    - **Function:** Rapidly hydrolyzes **acetylcholine (ACh)** in synaptic clefts & neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) to terminate neurotransmission. Essential for precise control of nerve impulses.
	    - **Location:** Primarily at postsynaptic NMJs, cholinergic synapses in CNS, red blood cells.
	- **PChE (Butyrylcholinesterase, "Plasma/Serum Cholinesterase"):**
	    - **Function:** Hydrolyzes **exogenous choline esters** (e.g., succinylcholine, mivacurium) and some local anesthetics (e.g., procaine, cocaine). Physiological role not fully understood, but may be involved in nerve signal transmission.
	    - **Location:** Synthesized in the liver; found in plasma, liver, pancreas, heart, brain (white matter).
		- Atypical pseudocholinesterase
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pseudocholinesterase is responsible for the breakdown of succinylcholine through ester hydrolysis.</span>
			- Atypical pseudocholinesterase breaks down succinylcholine slowly and thus prolongs the duration of muscle relaxation during anesthesia from a few minutes to a few hours; this may cause respiratory depression.

# Nondepolarizing NMJ blockers (nondepolarizing muscle relaxants)
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slow onset, long duration</span>
## Mechanism of action
- Compete with ACh to bind with the (nicotinic) ACh receptors at the motor end plate (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">competitive antagonists</span>) → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prevention of motor end plate depolarization (nondepolarization block)</span>
## Agents
- Rocuronium 
- Vecuronium 
- Atracurium
## Indications
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia</span> when succinylcholine is contraindicated
## Monitoring
- Train-of-four stimulation shows a fade-off in the amplitude of the muscle twitch
	- NDMRs block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) not only at the postsynaptic membrane <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">but also at presynaptic nerve terminals</span>
	- These presynaptic receptors n<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">ormally provide positive feedback for additional ACh release</span>
	- When blocked, there's <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">reduced mobilization of ACh vesicles for subsequent stimuli</span>
