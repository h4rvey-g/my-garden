1. **[[USMLE/Cardiology/Cardiac glycosides\|Digoxin]]**
    
    - Classic visual change: Yellow-green vision (xanthopsia), halos around lights.
    - Important because [[USMLE/Cardiology/Cardiac glycosides\|digoxin]] toxicity and its signs are frequently tested.
2. **Hydroxychloroquine / Chloroquine**
    
    - Classic toxicity: Retinopathy causing irreversible vision loss in chronic use.
    - Important for its classic adverse effect in clinical vignettes.
3. **Ethambutol**
    
    - Classic toxicity: Optic neuropathy leading to decreased visual acuity and color vision loss (red-green color blindness).
    - Important because of its link with [[USMLE/Infective disease/Tuberculosis\|tuberculosis]] treatment and vision loss.
4. **Topiramate**
    
    - Can cause acute myopia and [[USMLE/Neurology/Glaucoma\|angle-closure glaucoma]].
    - Increasingly encountered and thus high-yield.
5. **Isotretinoin**
    
    - Can cause decreased night vision and dry eyes.
    - Known teratogen and has ocular toxicity.
6. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Sildenafil (PDE5 inhibitors)**</span>
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Blue tint</span> to vision due to inhibition of PDE6 in retina.
    - Commonly tested in physiology and adverse effects.
7. **[[USMLE/Pharmacology/Corticosteroids\|Corticosteroids]] (long-term use)**
    
    - Can cause [[USMLE/Neurology/Cataract\|cataracts]] and [[USMLE/Neurology/Glaucoma\|glaucoma]].
    - Common medications with important ocular side effects.
