# Drug tolerance
---
**1. Acquired Pharmacokinetic Tolerance**

- **Mechanism:**
    - ADME: ↓ Absorption, ↑ Distribution, or ↑ Metabolism & Excretion (e.g., enzyme induction)
    - ↓ Plasma drug concentration relative to naïve state
- **Example:**
    - Rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) accelerates the metabolism of warfarin.
    - Carbamazepine induces its own metabolism after repeated dosing.

**2. Acquired Pharmacodynamic Tolerance**

- **Mechanism:**
    - ↓ Cellular response to drug (e.g., receptor downregulation)
    - Unchanged plasma drug concentration relative to naïve state
- **Example:**
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Chronic opioid use: ↓ expression & responsivity of μ receptor systems.</span>
    - Frequent albuterol rescue inhaler: ↓ expression of airway β2 receptors.

**3. Innate Tolerance**

- **Mechanism:**
    - Genetic (e.g., polymorphisms) & epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) differences
    - Leads to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic tolerance
    - Tolerance apparent from first dose
- **Example:**
    - Slow metabolizer CYP2C19 allele: ↓ clopidogrel activation (↓ antiplatelet effect)
    - Slow metabolizer CYP2D6 allele: ↓ codeine conversion to morphine (↓ analgesic effect)

**4. Behavioral (Functional) Tolerance**

- **Mechanism:**
    - Ability to compensate for drug-induced impairment through learning & practice
- **Example:**
    - Maintaining appearance & mannerisms to appear non-intoxicated at work
# Tachyphylaxis
---
- The underlying mechanism responsible for the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased effect of a drug involves depletion of the body's stores of an endogenous mediator and downregulation of receptors.</span>
- Cannot be overcome by increasing the drug dose.
- Develops quickly (within a few hours of dosing)
- Examples include:
	- Adrenergic agonists
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Receptor inactivation & internalization by arrestins</span>
	- Indirect sympathomimetics
		- Depletion of catecholamines from nerve terminals
	- [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Nitrates\|Nitrates]]
		- Depletion of reduced thiols decreases mtALDH activity & NO production
	- Desmopressin (vWD)
		- Depletion of vWF from endothelial storage sites
	- Barbiturates
		- Induction of [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Cytochrome P450\|CYP450]] enzymes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Direct sympathomimetic drugs (e.g., phenylephrine, [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Vitamin B3\|niacin]], LSD, [[USMLE/Neurology/MDMA\|MDMA]] ): the response to the repeated use of nasal decongestants (e.g., oxymetazoline) reduces the response over a short period of time and may cause rebound congestion (Rhinitis medicamentosa)</span>
		- Treatment: Discontinuation of intranasal sympathomimetics
