# Distribution (pharmacology)
---
- Volume of distribution
	- $V_d = \frac{\text{amount of drug in the body}}{\text{plasma drug concentration}}$
	- Theoretical value, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">if the drug totally stays in bloodstream, how much plasma volume is needed?</span>
		- **Low Vd:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">If a drug has a low V<sub>d</sub> (e.g., close to the plasma volume, ~3-5 L), it means the drug tends to stay _within_ the bloodstream (plasma).</span> The measured plasma concentration is relatively high compared to the total dose given.
		- **High Vd:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">If a drug has a high V<sub>d</sub> (e.g., hundreds of Liters, way more than normal plasma volume), it means the drug doesn't stay in the plasma. It distributes extensively _out_ of the bloodstream and into other tissues</span> (like fat, muscle, organs). This leaves only a small fraction of the total drug in the plasma, resulting in a _low_ measured plasma concentration relative to the total dose. To account for the entire dose at that low plasma concentration, the calculated "volume" needed becomes very large – hence, a high Vd.
	- Liver and kidney disease increase V<sub>d</sub> (↓ protein binding, ↑ V<sub>d</sub>). 
	- Drugs may be distributed in more than one compartment. 
	- Hemodialysis is most effective for drugs with a low V<sub>d</sub>.
