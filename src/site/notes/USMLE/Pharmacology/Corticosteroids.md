# Pharmacodynamics
---
1. Antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive
	- Acute effects (within minutes) 
		- ↓ Vasodilation and ↓ capillary permeability
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Leukocyte migration to inflammatory foci</span>
	- Long-term effects (within hours): Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis and demargination (loss of neutrophil binding to adhesive endothelial integrin molecules) → neutrophilic leukocytosis</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Steroids will paradoxically increase neutrophil counts in the blood</span>
2. Insulin resistant and increased blood glucose
	- **Increased Glucose Production:** Glucocorticoids <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stimulate the liver to produce more glucose (gluconeogenesis)</span> by increasing the expression of key enzymes. They also enhance the effects of hormones like glucagon, further boosting glucose production.
	- **Reduced Glucose Uptake:** They <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impair insulin signaling</span> in tissues like muscle and fat, making them less responsive to insulin, reducing glucose uptake from the blood. Glucocorticoids can also directly inhibit insulin secretion from the pancreas.
	- **Altered Fat Metabolism:** Glucocorticoids promote fat breakdown (lipolysis), increasing free fatty acids in the blood, which contributes to insulin resistance. Chronic exposure can also increase abdominal fat (visceral adiposity), linked to insulin resistance.

# Drugs
>[!Mnemonic] 
>长米的中坡可短了

>- 长效：地塞米松，倍他米松

## Short-Acting (Biological Half-life: 8-12 hours)
- **Drugs:**
    - **Hydrocortisone** (Cortisol)
    - **Cortisone**
- **Key Features:**
    - Have both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects.
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Best for replacement therapy in adrenal insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease) due to their shorter duration, which mimics the natural diurnal cortisol rhythm.</span>

## Intermediate-Acting (Biological Half-life: 12-36 hours)
- **Drugs:**
    - **Prednisone**
    - **Prednisolone**
    - **Methylprednisolone**
    - **Triamcinolone**
- **Key Features:**
    - Most commonly prescribed group for a wide range of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
    - Offer potent anti-inflammatory effects with lower mineralocorticoid activity compared to short-acting agents (especially methylprednisolone and triamcinolone).
    - Prednisone is a prodrug, converted to its active form, prednisolone, in the liver.

## Long-Acting (Biological Half-life: 36-72 hours)
- **Drugs:**
    - **Dexamethasone**
    - **Betamethasone**
- **Key Features:**
    - Highest glucocorticoid potency with virtually no mineralocorticoid effect.
    - Used for conditions requiring potent, long-lasting anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects (e.g., severe asthma exacerbations, cerebral edema, certain cancers).
    - High risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, making them less ideal for long-term daily use but suitable for short-term, high-dose therapy.
