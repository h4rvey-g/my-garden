# Pharmacodynamics
---
1. Antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive
	- Acute effects (within minutes) 
		- ↓ Vasodilation and ↓ capillary permeability
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Leukocyte migration to inflammatory foci</span>
	- Long-term effects (within hours): Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors (GRs)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis and demargination (loss of neutrophil binding to adhesive endothelial integrin molecules) → neutrophilic leukocytosis</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Steroids will paradoxically increase neutrophil counts in the blood</span>
2. Insulin resistant and increased blood glucose
	- **Increased Glucose Production:** Glucocorticoids <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">stimulate the liver to produce more glucose (gluconeogenesis)</span> by increasing the expression of key enzymes. They also enhance the effects of hormones like glucagon, further boosting glucose production.
	- **Reduced Glucose Uptake:** They <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impair insulin signaling</span> in tissues like muscle and fat, making them less responsive to insulin, reducing glucose uptake from the blood. Glucocorticoids can also directly inhibit insulin secretion from the pancreas.
	- **Altered Fat Metabolism:** Glucocorticoids promote fat breakdown (lipolysis), increasing free fatty acids in the blood, which contributes to insulin resistance. Chronic exposure can also increase abdominal fat (visceral adiposity), linked to insulin resistance.
