# Antiandrogen Drugs
---
## Finasteride

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Inhibits 5 alpha reductase.
*   **Indications:**
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).</span>
    *   Androgenetic alopecia.
*   **Adverse Effects:**
    *   Gynecomastia.
    *   Sexual dysfunction.

## Flutamide, Bicalutamide, Apalutamide, Enzalutamide

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Nonsteroidal competitive inhibition at androgen receptors (decreases steroid binding).
*   **Indications:**
	*   Metastatic <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">prostate cancer</span> (often in combination with GnRH analogs for medical castration).
    *   Hirsutism (e.g., in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome - PCOS).
    *   Androgenetic alopecia in female individuals.
*   **Adverse Effects:**
    *   Gynecomastia.
    *   Hypogonadism in males.
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hepatotoxicity (particularly noted with Flutamide, requires monitoring).</span>

## Cyproterone

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Blocks androgen receptor.
    *   Has progesterone-like effects.
*   **Indications:**
    *   Prostate cancer.
    *   Hirsutism.
    *   Precocious puberty.
    *   Hypersexuality.
*   **Adverse Effects:**
    *   *(Note: Specific adverse effects for Cyproterone were not listed separately in the provided text excerpt, but common antiandrogen effects like gynecomastia and potential progestogenic effects/mood changes can occur).*

## Spironolactone

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Blocks androgen receptor.
    *   Inhibits 17,20-desmolase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase (steroid synthesis enzymes).
    *   Inhibits 5-alpha reductase enzyme.
*   **Indications:**
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Androgenic effects of PCOS (e.g., hirsutism).</span>
    *   Androgenetic alopecia in female individuals.
    *   *(Also used commonly as a diuretic/for heart failure/hypertension due to its mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist activity, though not listed in this context).*
*   **Adverse Effects:**
    *   Gynecomastia.
    *   Breast tenderness.
    *   Amenorrhea.
    *   *(Hyperkalemia is a significant risk due to its primary mineralocorticoid antagonist effect).*

## Ketoconazole

*   **Mechanism of Action:**
    *   Inhibits several steps of adrenal and gonadal steroid synthesis (e.g., 17,20-desmolase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, 11Î²-hydroxylase, cholesterol side-chain cleavage).
*   **Indications:**
    *   Androgenic effects of PCOS (e.g., hirsutism) - *(Use is limited due to toxicity)*.
    *   Peripheral precocious puberty (e.g., McCune-Albright syndrome).
    *   Cushing syndrome.
    *   Advanced prostate cancer - *(Less common now due to newer agents and toxicity)*.
    *   *(Primarily known as an antifungal agent).*
*   **Adverse Effects / Characteristics:**
    *   Gynecomastia.
    *   Amenorrhea.
    *   Potent CYP 450 inhibitor (leading to numerous drug interactions).
    *   Hepatotoxicity (Black Box Warning in some regions).
    *   QTc prolongation.
    *   Adrenal insufficiency (due to cortisol synthesis inhibition).
