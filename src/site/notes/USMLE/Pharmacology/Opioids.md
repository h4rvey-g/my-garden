# Mechanism of Action
* **Receptors:** Act as agonists at opioid receptors (**μ, δ, κ**), which are Gi protein-coupled receptors. The **μ-receptor** is the most important for analgesia and the primary mediator of most clinical and adverse effects.
* **Cellular Effect:** Activation leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">closing of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (↓ neurotransmitter release, e.g., substance P, ACh, NE, glutamate) and opening of postsynaptic K⁺ channels (→ hyperpolarization, ↓ neuronal excitability).</span>![Pasted image 20250722103140.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250722103140.png)
* **Overall Effect:** Produces analgesia, sedation, and euphoria.
