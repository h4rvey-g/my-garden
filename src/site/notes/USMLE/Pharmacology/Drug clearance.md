# Excretion
---
- **Renal Clearance:** Drugs (or active metabolites) excreted by kidneys. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Water-soluble (polar, ionized at physiological pH)</span>
    
    - **High-Yield Drugs:**
        - **Antibiotics:** Aminoglycosides (Gentamicin), Vancomycin, most Penicillins & Cephalosporins (except Nafcillin, Ceftriaxone), Fluoroquinolones (most), TMP-SMX.
        - **Cardio:** Digoxin, Lisinopril (most ACEIs), Atenolol (hydrophilic beta-blockers).
        - **Other:** Lithium, Methotrexate (low dose), Gabapentin, Metformin, H2 blockers (Ranitidine).
    - **USMLE Pearl:** NSAIDs & ACEIs can affect renal clearance. Watch for nephrotoxicity.
- **Hepatic Clearance (Metabolism & Biliary Excretion):** Drugs metabolized by the liver (often by CYP450 enzymes) and/or excreted in bile. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lipid-soluble (non-polar)</span>
    
    - **High-Yield Drugs (Metabolism):**
        - Warfarin, most Benzodiazepines (safer: Lorazepam, Oxazepam, Temazepam - "LOT"), Statins, Macrolides (not Azithromycin), most Antidepressants & Antipsychotics, Opioids, Acetaminophen, Isoniazid, Rifampin, Phenytoin, Propranolol.
    - **High-Yield Drugs (Biliary Excretion/Enterohepatic Circulation):**
        - Ceftriaxone, Nafcillin, Azithromycin, Digoxin, Oral Contraceptives, Rifampin.
    - **USMLE Pearls:**
        - **CYP Inducers (decrease drug levels):** Rifampin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine ("CRAP GPS").
        - **CYP Inhibitors (increase drug levels):** Macrolides (not Azithro), Azole antifungals, Grapefruit Juice, Cimetidine, Ritonavir ("SICKFACES.COM G").
        - **First-pass metabolism:** Reduces oral bioavailability (e.g., Lidocaine, Propranolol).
- **Pulmonary Clearance:** For volatile substances.
    
    - **High-Yield Drugs:** Volatile anesthetics (e.g., Isoflurane), Ethanol (partially).
    - **USMLE Pearl:** Recovery from anesthesia depends on this.
# Metabolism
---
- **Zero order kinetics**: The rate of metabolism and/or elimination remains constant and is independent of the plasma concentration of a drug at steady state (Cp decreases linearly over time)
	- Zero-order is a capacity-limited elimination.
	- $\text{Rate of elimination} = k_0$
	- Plasma concentration over time: $C_p(t) = C_p(0) - k_0 t$
	- Examples include ethanol, phenytoin, aspirin (at high concentrations) 
	    - **High-Yield Drugs ("PEA"):**
	        - **P**henytoin
	        - **E**thanol
	        - **A**spirin (at high doses/overdose)
    - **USMLE Pearl:** Small dose changes can lead to large changes in plasma concentration and toxicity.
- **First order kinetics**: The rate of metabolism and/or elimination is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">directly proportional to the plasma concentration of the drug</span> (Cp decreases exponentially over time)
	- First-order is a flow-dependent elimination.
	- $\text{Rate of elimination} = k \cdot C_p$
	- Plasma concentration over time: $C_p(t) = C_p(0) \cdot e^{-kt}$
	- Half life: $t_{1/2} = \frac{0.693}{k}$
	- Applies to most drugs
