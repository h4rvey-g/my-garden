# Tumor Grade: Degree of Differentiation
---
- **What it is:** A microscopic assessment of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">how much the cancer cells resemble the normal, healthy cells</span> of the tissue they originated from (i.e., degree of differentiation). <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It reflects the tumor's potential aggressiveness.</span>
- **How it's Determined:** A pathologist examines a biopsy specimen under a microscope.
- **Scale:** Typically graded on a scale of 1 to 4.
    - **Grade 1 (Low-Grade):** Well-differentiated. Cells look very similar to normal cells; slow-growing.
    - **Grade 2 (Intermediate-Grade):** Moderately-differentiated. Cells look somewhat abnormal.
    - **Grade 3-4 (High-Grade):** Poorly-differentiated or undifferentiated (anaplastic). Cells look very abnormal and disorganized; tend to grow and spread quickly.
- **Clinical Significance:** A lower grade generally corresponds to a better prognosis. A higher grade suggests a more aggressive cancer that may require more aggressive treatment.
# Tumor Stage: Extent of Spread
---
- **What it is:** An assessment of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">size of the tumor and how far it has spread from its original location</span>. It is the strongest predictor of a patient's <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">outcome</span>.
- **How it's Determined:** Based on clinical findings, imaging (e.g., CT, PET scans), and pathological findings from surgery.
- **The TNM System:** The most common system for staging solid tumors.
    - **T (Tumor):** Describes the size and/or local invasion of the primary tumor. (e.g., T1-T4, with higher numbers indicating larger size or deeper invasion). `Tis` refers to carcinoma in situ (pre-invasive).
    - **N (Nodes):** Indicates the extent of spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes. (e.g., N0 for no nodal involvement, N1-N3 for increasing involvement).
    - **M (Metastasis):** Refers to the presence of distant spread to other organs. (e.g., M0 for no distant metastases, M1 for presence of distant metastases).
- **Clinical Significance:** The TNM values are combined to determine an overall stage (usually Stage 0 to IV).
    - **Stage 0:** Carcinoma in situ.
    - **Stage I-III:** Increasing tumor size and local/regional spread.
    - **Stage IV:** The cancer has metastasized to distant sites. This stage is associated with the worst prognosis.

**Key Differentiating Buzzwords & Concepts**

- **Grade = "Differentiation"** (microscopic)
- **Stage = "Spread"** (anatomic, macroscopic)
- **Prognosis:** Stage > Grade. The presence of metastases (**M1**) is the single most important prognostic factor in the TNM system.
