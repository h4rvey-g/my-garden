# Lead (Pb) Poisoning

*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    *   Inhibits **ferrochelatase** and **ALA dehydratase** in heme synthesis → microcytic, hypochromic anemia.
    *   Inhibits rRNA degradation → aggregates of ribosomes (**basophilic stippling**).
    *   Sources: Chipped paint in old houses (children), batteries, ammunition, construction.

*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **"LEAD" mnemonic:**
        *   **L**ead lines on gingiva (**Burton lines**) and on metaphyses of long bones on x-ray (in children).
        *   **E**ncephalopathy (irritability, developmental regression, coma) and **E**rythrocyte basophilic stippling.
        *   **A**bdominal colic (constipation) and **A**nemia (sideroblastic).
        *   **D**rops (wrist drop, foot drop) due to peripheral neuropathy.
    *   Also: Fatigue, memory loss, headache, HTN.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   ↑ blood lead level.
    *   Peripheral smear: **Basophilic stippling**.
    *   CBC: Microcytic anemia.
    *   ↑ Zinc protoporphyrin levels.

*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   **Chelation therapy** is based on severity.
    *   **Succimer** (oral): Used for mild-moderate poisoning, especially in children.
    *   **Dimercaprol (BAL)** + **EDTA**: Used for severe poisoning/encephalopathy.
        *   Note: Dimercaprol is given first.

# Iron (Fe) Poisoning

*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    *   Ingestion of iron supplements (e.g., prenatal vitamins), especially in children.
    *   Direct corrosive effect on GI mucosa → hematemesis, bloody diarrhea.
    *   Systemic toxicity via **Fenton reaction** generates free radicals → metabolic acidosis, hepatic necrosis, shock.

*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Acute (in stages):**
        1.  **GI Phase (0-6 hrs):** N/V, abdominal pain, hematemesis, melena.
        2.  **Latent Phase (6-24 hrs):** Apparent improvement.
        3.  **Systemic Toxicity (12-72 hrs):** Shock, **anion gap metabolic acidosis**, hepatic failure, coagulopathy.
    *   **Chronic:** Gastric scarring/pyloric stenosis.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   High serum iron level, high ferritin, low TIBC.
    *   **Anion gap metabolic acidosis**.
    *   Abdominal X-ray may show radiopaque pills.

*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   Supportive care (ABCs), whole bowel irrigation.
    *   **Deferoxamine** (IV): Chelating agent for moderate-severe toxicity. Binds iron, forming ferrioxamine (renally excreted, gives urine a **vin-rosé** color).
    *   Oral: Deferasirox, Deferiprone.

# Arsenic (As) Poisoning

*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    *   Inhibits enzymes containing sulfhydryl groups, especially **pyruvate dehydrogenase**.
    *   Sources: Contaminated groundwater (wells), pesticides, pressure-treated wood, smelting industries.

*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   **Acute:**
        *   Severe watery, "rice-water" diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain.
        *   Garlic breath odor.
        *   Cardiovascular: QT prolongation, hypotension.
    *   **Chronic:**
        *   Skin: Hyperkeratosis (palms/soles), hypo/hyperpigmentation.
        *   Neuropathy: Stocking-glove sensory neuropathy.
        *   Nails: **Mees' lines** (transverse white lines).
        *   Increased risk of skin, lung, and liver cancers.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Urine arsenic level is the best test for recent exposure.

*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   **Dimercaprol (BAL)**.
    *   **Succimer**.

# Mercury (Hg) Poisoning

*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    *   Binds to sulfhydryl groups on enzymes, causing damage.
    *   Sources: Ingestion of contaminated fish (organic mercury - methylmercury), dental amalgams, thermometers, mining.

*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   Highly variable; depends on the form of mercury.
    *   Neurotoxicity is prominent: Ataxia, tremor, memory loss, irritability ("mad as a hatter").
    *   <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mucocutaneous: gingivitis; diaphoresis; swelling, redness, desquamation of hands/feet.</span>
    *   Renal: Membranous nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis.
    *   GI: Gingivostomatitis.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   Blood mercury level (acute) or 24-hour urine mercury level (chronic).

*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   **Dimercaprol (BAL)**, **Succimer**.
    *   Note: Chelation is not effective for organic mercury (methylmercury).

# Copper (Cu) Overload - Wilson Disease

*   **Pathophysiology/Etiology:**
    *   Autosomal recessive mutation in **ATP7B gene** on chromosome 13.
    *   Impaired copper transport into bile and incorporation into ceruloplasmin → copper accumulation in liver, brain (basal ganglia), cornea, kidneys.
    *   Excess free copper generates damaging free radicals.

*   **Clinical Presentation:**
    *   Presents in childhood/young adulthood (<35 yo).
    *   **Hepatic:** Asymptomatic ↑ LFTs to cirrhosis and acute liver failure.
    *   **Neurologic:** Parkinsonism-like symptoms (tremor, rigidity, dysarthria), dystonia, ataxia.
    *   **Psychiatric:** Depression, personality changes.
    *   **Ophthalmic:** **Kayser-Fleischer rings** (copper deposits in Descemet's membrane of the cornea), seen on slit-lamp exam.

*   **Diagnosis:**
    *   ↓ **Serum ceruloplasmin** (key finding).
    *   ↑ Urinary copper excretion.
    *   ↑ Hepatic copper on liver biopsy (gold standard).

*   **Management/Treatment:**
    *   Chelating agents: **D-penicillamine**, **Trientine**.
    *   Oral **Zinc**: Interferes with dietary copper absorption.
