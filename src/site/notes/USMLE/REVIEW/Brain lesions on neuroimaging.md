| **Neurocysticercosis**       | History of travel/living in endemic area (e.g., Latin America)          | Cysts in various stages: non-enhancing → ring-enhancing → **calcified lesions** ("brain stones") | Multiple, in different stages                                                                | History of exposure + presence of **calcified lesions and/or scolex** ("dot-in-a-box")                          |
