A key differentiator is that upper airway obstruction typically causes **[[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|stridor]]** (an inspiratory sound), while lower airway disease is characterized by **[[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|wheezing]]** (an expiratory sound).

# Upper Airway Diseases

The primary sign of upper airway obstruction is [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|stridor]], a high-pitched sound caused by turbulent airflow through a narrowed larynx or trachea.

| Condition | **[[USMLE/Respiratory/Croup\|Croup]] (Laryngotracheobronchitis)** | **Epiglottitis** | **Bacterial Tracheitis** | **Foreign Body Aspiration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Patho/Etiology** | **Parainfluenza virus** (most common). Inflammation/edema of subglottic area. | **H. influenzae type b** (less common with Hib vaccine). *S. pyogenes*, *S. aureus*. Inflammation/edema of supraglottic structures. | **S. aureus** (most common). Often a bacterial superinfection after a viral illness (e.g., croup). Thick, purulent exudates in the trachea. | Aspiration of object (e.g., peanut, coin, toy part) into the airway. |
| **Clinical Presentation** | Age: 6 mo - 3 yr. **Barking "seal-like" cough**, inspiratory stridor, hoarseness. Symptoms often worse at night after a viral prodrome. | Age: 2-7 yr (unvaccinated). **Acute onset**, high fever, **dysphagia, drooling, distress** ("3 D's"). **Tripod position** (sitting up, leaning forward), muffled "hot potato" voice. No cough. | Age: 6 mo - 6 yr. High fever, toxic appearance, inspiratory/expiratory stridor. **Initial croup-like symptoms that rapidly worsen and don't respond to croup treatment**. Productive cough with thick secretions. | Age: 1-3 yr. **Sudden onset** of choking, coughing, stridor, or wheezing. Unilateral wheezing or decreased breath sounds. |
| **Diagnosis** | **Clinical diagnosis**. X-ray (AP neck) shows **"steeple sign"** (subglottic narrowing), but not required for diagnosis. | **Do NOT examine throat**. Lateral neck X-ray shows **"thumb sign"** (enlarged epiglottis). Definitive Dx: Direct laryngoscopy in a controlled setting (OR). | X-ray may show steeple sign or subglottic narrowing with a "shaggy" tracheal border. Definitive Dx: Bronchoscopy shows purulent secretions. | **History is key**. Chest X-ray may show a radiopaque object or signs of air trapping (hyperinflation) on the affected side. **Bronchoscopy** is both diagnostic and therapeutic. |
| **Management** | Mild: Humidified air, corticosteroids (dexamethasone). Moderate/Severe: **Corticosteroids + nebulized racemic epinephrine**. | **Emergency! Intubate in the OR**. IV antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone) and corticosteroids. | **Airway management** (intubation often required). IV antibiotics (e.g., Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone). Bronchoscopy for secretion removal. | **Rigid bronchoscopy** for removal of the object. |

### **Lower Airway Diseases**

Lower airway diseases involve the bronchi and bronchioles, typically presenting with wheezing, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing.

| Condition                          | **Bronchiolitis**                                                                                                                                                      | **Asthma**                                                                                                                                                     | **Pneumonia**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patho/Etiology**                 | **RSV** (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is the most common cause. Inflammation and necrosis of small airway epithelial cells leading to obstruction.                     | Reversible bronchoconstriction due to airway hyperresponsiveness to various triggers (allergens, viruses, cold air).                                           | Infection of the lung parenchyma. Can be viral (RSV, influenza) or bacterial (*S. pneumoniae*, *M. pneumoniae*).                                                                                 |
| **Clinical Presentation**          | Age: **< 2 years**. Preceded by URI symptoms (rhinorrhea, cough). **Diffuse wheezing**, crackles, tachypnea, increased work of breathing (retractions, nasal flaring). | Age: **> 2 years**. **Recurrent episodes of wheezing**, cough (often nocturnal), and dyspnea. Personal or family history of atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis). | Can occur at any age. Fever, cough, tachypnea. Auscultation may reveal crackles, rhonchi, or decreased breath sounds over a focal area. Wheezing is less common than in bronchiolitis or asthma. |
| **Diagnosis**                      | **Clinical diagnosis**. Chest X-ray is not routinely needed but may show hyperinflation and patchy atelectasis.                                                        | **History** and physical exam. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry) in older children show obstructive pattern with reversibility after bronchodilator use.   | **Chest X-ray** is key: shows lobar consolidation (bacterial), diffuse interstitial infiltrates (viral/atypical).                                                                                |
| **Management**                     | **Supportive care**: Hydration, nasal suctioning, and supplemental O2 if needed. Bronchodilators and steroids are **not** routinely recommended.                       | **SABA** (e.g., Albuterol) for acute attacks. Inhaled corticosteroids for long-term control. Systemic steroids for exacerbations.                              | **Bacterial**: Amoxicillin (first-line). Macrolides for atypical. **Viral**: Supportive care. Hospitalize for respiratory distress.                                                              |
| **Key Associations/Complications** | Apnea (especially in premature infants and those <2 months). Risk factor for developing asthma later in life.                                                          | Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis.                                                                                                                          | Pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess.                                                                                                                                                         |
