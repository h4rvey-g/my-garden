# Inflammatory & Autoimmune Conditions

| Disease | Key Histological Findings | Buzzwords / Stains |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acute Viral Hepatitis** | - **Panlobular inflammation** (lymphocytic) & hepatocyte necrosis. <br> - **Lobular disarray**; ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes. <br> - **Apoptotic bodies** (Councilman bodies). <br> - +/- Cholestasis. | - **"Spotty necrosis,"** lobular disarray. <br> - Bridging necrosis (severe cases). |
| **Chronic Viral Hepatitis** | - **Portal tract inflammation** (predominantly lymphocytic). <br> - **Interface hepatitis** ("piecemeal necrosis"): inflammation spills from portal tracts into the adjacent parenchyma. <br> - Fibrosis progressing from portal tracts to cirrhosis. <br> - **HBV:** "Ground-glass" hepatocytes (HBsAg accumulation). <br> - **HCV:** Lymphoid aggregates/follicles in portal tracts, macrovesicular steatosis, bile duct damage. | - **Interface hepatitis**. <br> - **Ground-glass hepatocytes** (HBV). <br> - **Lymphoid aggregates** (HCV). |
| **Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH)** | - **Dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate** in portal tracts and extending into the lobule. <br> - **Severe interface hepatitis** is characteristic. <br> - **Hepatocyte rosetting** (regenerative clusters). <br> - Emperipolesis (lymphocytes within hepatocyte cytoplasm). | - Prominent **plasma cells**. <br> - Hepatocyte rosettes. |

# Steatotic Liver Diseases

| Disease | Key Histological Findings | Buzzwords / Stains |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD)** | - **Steatosis:** Macrovesicular fat, predominantly centrilobular (Zone 3). <br> - **Steatohepatitis (ASH):** Hepatocyte ballooning, **Mallory-Denk bodies** (intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions), **neutrophilic infiltrate**. <br> - **Fibrosis:** Perivenular and pericellular ("chicken-wire") fibrosis in Zone 3, progressing to cirrhosis. | - **Mallory-Denk bodies**. <br> - **Neutrophilic** inflammation. <br> - **Sclerosing hyaline necrosis**. <br> - Centrilobular (Zone 3) accentuation. |
| **Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/NASH)** | - **NAFL:** Macrovesicular steatosis (>5% of hepatocytes). <br> - **NASH:** Steatosis + inflammation (lobular, mixed) + hepatocyte injury (e.g., **ballooning**). <br> - Mallory-Denk bodies may be present but are often less prominent than in ALD. <br> - **Fibrosis:** Perisinusoidal/pericellular ("chicken-wire") pattern, often starting in Zone 3. | - Indistinguishable from ALD on histology alone; requires clinical correlation (absence of significant alcohol use). |

# Cholestatic & Biliary Diseases

| Disease | Key Histological Findings | Buzzwords / Stains |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)** | - Autoimmune destruction of **small to medium intrahepatic bile ducts**. <br> - **Florid duct lesion:** Lymphocytic cholangitis with or without granulomas attacking a bile duct. <br> - Ductopenia (loss of bile ducts) in later stages. <br> - Portal inflammation (lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils). | - **Florid duct lesion**. <br> - **Granulomatous** destruction of bile ducts. <br> - AMA positive. |
| **Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)** | - Inflammation and fibrosis of **intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts**. <br> - **Periductal concentric fibrosis ("onion-skinning")** around bile ducts. <br> - Progressive obliteration of ducts, leaving a fibrous cord (**fibro-obliterative lesion**). <br> - Ductopenia is common. | - **"Onion-skin" fibrosis**. <br> - Beaded appearance on ERCP/MRCP. |

# Metabolic & Genetic Diseases

| Disease | Key Histological Findings | Buzzwords / Stains |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH)** | - **Heavy iron deposition** primarily in **hepatocytes** (parenchymal pattern), particularly in a periportal (Zone 1) distribution. <br> - Iron also seen in bile duct epithelium and Kupffer cells as disease progresses. <br> - Eventually leads to micronodular cirrhosis. | - **Prussian blue stain** highlights hemosiderin (iron) as blue granules. |
| **Wilson Disease** | - Findings are highly variable; can mimic steatohepatitis, chronic hepatitis, or cirrhosis. <br> - Features include macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte necrosis, glycogenated nuclei, and Mallory-Denk bodies. <br> - Copper accumulation may be demonstrable but is often uneven. | - Nonspecific findings; high index of suspicion needed. <br> - **Rhodanine** or **Orcein** stain for copper (positive staining is confirmatory, but negative does not exclude). |
| **Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (A1AT) Deficiency** | - **Round, eosinophilic, PAS-positive, diastase-resistant (PAS-D+) globules** within the cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes. <br> - These globules are aggregates of the misfolded A1AT protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br> - Can lead to cholestasis in neonates or cirrhosis in adults. | - **PAS-D positive globules** in periportal hepatocytes. |

| **Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)** | - Tumor cells resemble hepatocytes, often arranged in **thickened trabeculae (>3 cells thick)**, solid, or pseudo-glandular patterns. <br> - Loss of reticulin framework. <br> - Sinusoidal capillarization (positive for CD34). <br> - May produce bile.           | - **Thickened trabeculae**. <br> - **Polygonal cells** with eosinophilic cytoplasm. <br> - Bile production by tumor cells. |
| **Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)**       | - **Adenocarcinoma** forming glandular or duct-like structures. <br> - Associated with a **dense, desmoplastic (fibrous) stroma**. <br> - Tumor cells are cuboidal to columnar and often mucin-producing. <br> - Perineural and lymphovascular invasion are common. | - **Glandular structures**. <br> - **Desmoplastic stroma**. <br> - Mucin production.                                       |
