Hemagglutinin is a surface glycoprotein used by several viruses to bind to sialic acid receptors on host cells (including red blood cells, hence the name "hemagglutinin" due to its ability to agglutinate RBCs in vitro), facilitating viral entry.
- **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|Influenza]] Virus:** Has HA for cell attachment; key target for vaccines and subject to antigenic drift/shift.
- **[[USMLE/MSK/Measles\|Measles]] Virus:** Has H protein (hemagglutinin) for attachment. (MMR vaccine component).
- **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Mumps\|Mumps]] Virus:** Has HN protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase) for attachment and release. (MMR vaccine component).
- **Parainfluenza Virus:** Has HN protein (hemagglutinin-neuraminidase); common cause of [[USMLE/Respiratory/Croup\|croup]].
- **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Rubella\|Rubella]] Virus:** E1 glycoprotein has hemagglutinating activity, involved in attachment. (MMR vaccine component, relevant for CRS).

**Also notable (Bacterial):**

- _**Bordetella [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pertussis\|pertussis]]:**_ Produces Filamentous Hemagglutinin (FHA) adhesin, important for [[USMLE/Infective disease/Pertussis\|whooping cough]] pathogenesis and vaccine component.
