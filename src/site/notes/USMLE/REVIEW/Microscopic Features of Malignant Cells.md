# Overview
1. **Large and Irregular Nuclei:**
    
    - **Appearance:** Nuclei are often much larger than normal, with irregular shapes, and take up a greater portion of the cell (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio</span>). They may appear darker than normal (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperchromasia</span>).
    - **Mechanism:** Caused by increased DNA content due to errors in cell division and ongoing mutations, leading to genomic instability and altered nuclear structure.
2. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Prominent and Irregular Nucleoli:**</span>
    ![Pasted image 20250521103014.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250521103014.png)
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Appearance:** The nucleoli (structures within the nucleus) are often enlarged, more numerous, and irregularly shaped.</span>
    - **Mechanism:** Reflects <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased ribosome production</span> needed for the high protein synthesis rates required by rapidly dividing cells.
3. **Variation in Cell Size and Shape (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Pleomorphism</span>):**
    
    - **Appearance:** Cancer cells within a tumor often vary significantly in their overall size and shape, unlike uniform normal cells.
    - **Mechanism:** Results from ongoing genetic mutations and a breakdown of normal cellular structural controls.
4. **Loss of Differentiation ([[USMLE/Pathology/Cellular adaptations\|Anaplasia]]):**
    
    - **Appearance:** Cells lose the specialized features of their normal counterparts and appear more primitive.
    - **Mechanism:** Genetic changes disrupt the normal developmental programs that control cell specialization.
5. **Disorganized Arrangement & Loss of Polarity:**
    
    - **Appearance:** Cells lose their normal orderly arrangement within tissues and their typical orientation.
    - **Mechanism:** Caused by alterations in cell adhesion molecules and the proteins that maintain tissue structure and cell orientation, allowing for chaotic growth.
6. **Increased and Abnormal Cell Division (Mitoses):**
    
    - **Appearance:** More cells are seen actively dividing, and these divisions may be abnormal (e.g., tripolar spindles).
    - **Mechanism:** Cancer cells bypass normal cell cycle controls due to mutations in regulatory genes, leading to uncontrolled and often faulty cell division.
7. **Invasive Growth (Implied Feature):**
    
    - **Appearance:** While not a single cell feature, evidence of cells infiltrating surrounding normal tissues is a hallmark.
    - **Mechanism:** Cancer cells gain the ability to break down tissue barriers and migrate, driven by changes in adhesion, motility, and enzyme production.
