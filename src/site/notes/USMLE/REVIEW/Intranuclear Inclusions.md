<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Intranuclear inclusions are aggregates of protein or viral particles within the nucleus.</span> Their presence is a key histological finding for several diseases, particularly viral infections.
# Viral Inclusions

*   **Cowdry Type A Inclusions**
    *   **Appearance:** Large, eosinophilic (pink), amorphous inclusions that push chromatin to the nuclear membrane ("margination").
    *   **Associated Conditions:**
        *   **Herpes Simplex Virus ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-1, [[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]]-2):** Seen in infected epithelial cells (e.g., Tzanck smear) or neurons (e.g., herpes encephalitis).
        *   **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Shingles\|Varicella-Zoster Virus]] ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Shingles\|VZV]]):** Found in skin lesions of chickenpox or [[USMLE/Infective disease/Shingles\|shingles]].
        *   **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Cytomegalovirus infection\|Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV):** Although [[USMLE/Infective disease/Cytomegalovirus infection\|CMV]] is famous for another inclusion type, it can also show Cowdry A inclusions.
    *   **Buzzwords:** **"Punched-out" ulcers** ([[USMLE/Infective disease/Herpesviruses\|HSV]] esophagitis), **multinucleated giant cells**.

*   **"Owl's Eye" Inclusions (Cowdry Type B-like)**
    *   **Appearance:** Large, basophilic (purple) central inclusion surrounded by a clear halo, giving the appearance of an owl's eye. Found in greatly enlarged cells (cytomegaly).
    *   **Associated Condition:** **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Cytomegalovirus infection\|Cytomegalovirus]] (CMV)**.
    *   **High-Yield Scenarios:** CMV retinitis, esophagitis, or [[USMLE/Respiratory/Pneumonia\|pneumonia]] in immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS, transplant recipients). Congenital CMV infection.

*   **"Ground-Glass" Nuclei**
    *   **Appearance:** Homogenous, opaque appearance of the entire nucleus due to viral particles, obscuring normal chromatin detail.
    *   **Associated Condition:** **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)**, particularly in early-stage infection before Cowdry A inclusions form. Can also be seen in liver cells with [[USMLE/GI/Hepatitis B\|Hepatitis B]] virus (though cytoplasmic inclusions are more classic).

*   **[[USMLE/MSK/Measles\|Measles]] Virus Inclusions**
    *   **Appearance:** Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions.
    *   **Associated Condition:** **[[USMLE/MSK/Measles\|Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis]] (SSPE)**, a rare, progressive, fatal brain disorder caused by persistent [[USMLE/MSK/Measles\|measles]] virus infection. Found in both neurons and [[USMLE/Neurology/Glial cells\|glial cells]].

# Non-Viral Inclusions

*   **[[USMLE/Pathology/Lead poisoning\|Lead Poisoning]] (Plumbism)**
    *   **Appearance:** Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions.
    *   **Location:** Most prominently seen in the epithelial cells of the renal proximal convoluted tubules.
    *   **Clinical Context:** Patient with microcytic [[USMLE/Blood/Anemia\|anemia]], abdominal pain ("lead colic"), wrist/foot drop, and cognitive deficits (especially in children).

*   **Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma**
    *   **Appearance:**
        *   **Orphan Annie Eye Nuclei:** Large, overlapping nuclei with finely dispersed, pale chromatin, giving a clear or empty appearance.
        *   **Intranuclear Pseudoinclusions:** Invaginations of the cytoplasm into the nucleus that appear as eosinophilic inclusions on H&E stain.
    *   **Buzzwords:** **[[USMLE/Pathology/Psammoma body\|Psammoma bodies]]** (laminated calcifications).

*   **Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID)**
    *   **Appearance:** Eosinophilic, hyaline intranuclear inclusions.
    *   **Associated Condition:** A rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Inclusions can be found in neurons and also in somatic cells, like those in skin or renal biopsies.
