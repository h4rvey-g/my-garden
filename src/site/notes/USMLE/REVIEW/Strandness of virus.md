- Most DNA viruses are **double-stranded (dsDNA)**, replicate in the **nucleus** (exception: Poxvirus), and have an **icosahedral** capsid (exception: Poxvirus).
- Most RNA viruses are **single-stranded (ssRNA)**, replicate in the **cytoplasm** (exceptions: Orthomyxoviruses and Retroviruses), and are **enveloped**.
- **Key Exceptions to Remember:**
	- **DNA in Cytoplasm:** Poxvirus
	- **RNA in Nucleus:** Orthomyxovirus, Retrovirus

	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**Double-Stranded RNA:** Reovirus</span>
	- **Segmented Genomes (BOAR):** **B**unyavirus, **O**rthomyxovirus, **A**renavirus, **R**eovirus (important for genetic reassortment, e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Influenza\|influenza]] antigenic shift)
