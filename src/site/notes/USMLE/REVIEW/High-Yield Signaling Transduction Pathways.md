### G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)

GPCRs are 7-transmembrane domain receptors. The G-protein itself is a heterotrimeric (α, β, γ) intracellular protein. Ligand binding causes a conformational change, leading to the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α-subunit, which then dissociates and activates downstream effectors.

# 1. Gs and Gi (cAMP Pathway)

*   **Mechanism (Gs - stimulatory):**
    1.  Ligand binds GPCR → Gsα activated.
    2.  Gsα activates **Adenylyl Cyclase**.
    3.  Adenylyl Cyclase converts ATP → **cAMP** (second messenger).
    4.  cAMP activates **Protein Kinase A (PKA)** → phosphorylation of intracellular proteins → cellular effect.
*   **Mechanism (Gi - inhibitory):**
    1.  Ligand binds GPCR → Giα activated.
    2.  Giα **inhibits Adenylyl Cyclase** → ↓ cAMP → ↓ PKA activity.
*   **High-Yield Ligands & Receptors:**
    *   **Gs (↑ cAMP):** β-adrenergic (β1, β2), Glucagon, Histamine (H2), TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, PTH, ADH (V2).
        *   **Mnemonic:** "FLAT ChAMP" (FSH, LH, ACTH, TSH, CRH, hCG, ADH (V2), MSH, PTH, Calcitonin, GHRH, Glucagon).
    *   **Gi (↓ cAMP):** α2-adrenergic, Muscarinic (M2), Dopamine (D2), Somatostatin.
*   **Key Associations:**
    *   **Cholera Toxin:** Irreversibly activates Gs → massive ↑ cAMP in intestinal mucosa → watery diarrhea.
    *   **Pertussis Toxin:** Irreversibly inhibits Gi → massive ↑ cAMP → impairs phagocytosis.

# 2. Gq (IP3/DAG Pathway)

*   **Mechanism (Gq):**
    1.  Ligand binds GPCR → Gqα activated.
    2.  Gqα activates **Phospholipase C (PLC)**.
    3.  PLC cleaves PIP2 → **IP3** (inositol trisphosphate) and **DAG** (diacylglycerol).
    4.  **IP3** → binds to receptors on the ER → release of intracellular **Ca²⁺**.
    5.  **DAG** and **Ca²⁺** activate **Protein Kinase C (PKC)** → cellular effect (e.g., smooth muscle contraction).
*   **High-Yield Ligands & Receptors:**
    *   α1-adrenergic, Muscarinic (M1, M3), ADH (V1), Angiotensin II, Oxytocin, TRH, GnRH, Histamine (H1), Gastrin.
    *   **Mnemonic:** "GOAT HAG" (GnRH, Oxytocin, ADH (V1), TRH, Histamine (H1), Angiotensin II, Gastrin).

# 3. cGMP Pathway

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Nitric Oxide (NO):** Diffuses into cell → activates soluble **Guanylate Cyclase** → GTP to **cGMP**.
    *   **ANP/BNP:** Bind to receptor with intrinsic **Guanylate Cyclase** activity → GTP to **cGMP**.
    *   cGMP activates **Protein Kinase G (PKG)** → smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation).
*   **High-Yield Ligands:**
    *   Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), Nitric Oxide (NO).
*   **Key Associations:**
    *   **Sildenafil (Viagra):** Inhibits cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE-5), leading to ↑ cGMP and vasodilation.

# 4. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Pathway

*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Ligand (often a growth factor) binding → receptor dimerization.
    2.  Intrinsic **tyrosine kinase** domains autophosphorylate each other.
    3.  Phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for signaling proteins (e.g., GRB2).
    4.  Activates the **RAS-MAP Kinase pathway** → translocation to nucleus → influences gene transcription (cell growth, proliferation, differentiation).
*   **High-Yield Ligands:**
    *   **Insulin**, Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF).
*   **Key Associations:**
    *   Mutations in **RAS** and other components of this pathway are common in many cancers (oncogenes).

# 5. Non-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (JAK-STAT Pathway)

*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Ligand (e.g., cytokine) binds to receptor → receptor dimerization.
    2.  Receptor has no intrinsic kinase activity but recruits intracellular **Janus Kinases (JAKs)**.
    3.  JAKs cross-phosphorylate each other and the receptor.
    4.  **STATs** (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) dock on phosphorylated sites, are phosphorylated by JAKs.
    5.  Phosphorylated STATs dimerize, translocate to nucleus, and act as transcription factors.
*   **High-Yield Ligands:**
    *   **Cytokines** (e.g., Interferons, Interleukins), Growth Hormone (GH), Prolactin, Erythropoietin (EPO), Thrombopoietin (TPO).
    *   **Mnemonic:** "PIGGLET" (Prolactin, Immunomodulators, GH, G-CSF, EPO, TPO).
*   **Key Associations:**
    *   **JAK inhibitors** (e.g., Tofacitinib) are used to treat autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.

# 6. Intracellular (Steroid) Receptor Pathway

*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Lipophilic hormones (e.g., steroids, thyroid hormone) diffuse across the cell membrane.
    2.  Bind to receptors in the **cytoplasm or nucleus**.
    3.  Receptor-hormone complex undergoes a conformational change, translocates to the nucleus (if not already there).
    4.  Binds to hormone-responsive elements (HREs) on DNA → acts as a transcription factor to regulate gene expression.
    5.  Effects are slow (hours to days) but sustained.
*   **High-Yield Ligands:**
    *   **Cytoplasmic receptors:** Cortisol, Aldosterone, Testosterone.
    *   **Nuclear receptors:** Thyroid hormone (T3/T4), Vitamin D, Estrogen, Progesterone.
    *   **Mnemonic for intracellular receptors:** "VETTT CAP" (Vitamin D, Estrogen, Testosterone, T3/T4, Cortisol, Aldosterone, Progesterone).
