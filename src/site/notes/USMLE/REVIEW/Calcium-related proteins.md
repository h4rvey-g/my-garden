 **1. Calsequestrin** 

 *   **Function:** Calsequestrin is a calcium-binding protein that acts as a calcium buffer inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of muscle cells. 
 *   **Mechanism:** It helps <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">store large amounts of calcium in the SR, which is essential for muscle contraction.</span> The release of this stored calcium triggers muscle contraction. 
 *   **Location:** Primarily found in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal and cardiac muscle. 
 *   **Clinical Note:** Mutations in the gene for cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2) are linked to a type of arrhythmia called catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which can cause sudden death. 

 **2. Calmodulin** 

 *   **Function:** Calmodulin is a calcium-activated protein that <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">acts as a messenger.</span> When calcium levels rise in the cell, calmodulin binds to it and then activates other proteins. 
 *   **Mechanism:** It's a key player in many cellular processes, including inflammation, metabolism, apoptosis, and muscle contraction. In the heart, it plays a critical role in regulating the channels that control the heart's electrical stability. 
 *   **Location:** Found in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells. 
 *   **Clinical Note:** The three genes that code for calmodulin are highly conserved, meaning they have changed very little over the course of evolution. This highlights its importance for cellular function. 

 **3. [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|Calcitonin]]** 

 *   **Function:** [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|Calcitonin]] is a hormone that helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. 
 *   **Mechanism:** When blood calcium levels get too high, the thyroid gland releases [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|calcitonin]]. It works by slowing down the breakdown of bone (which releases calcium into the blood) and by increasing the amount of calcium the kidneys excrete. 
 *   **Location:** It's produced by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">C-cells of the thyroid gland. </span>
 *   **Clinical Note:** [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|Calcitonin]] has an opposing function to parathyroid hormone (PTH), which raises blood calcium levels. However, PTH is considered to have a more significant role in calcium regulation than [[USMLE/Endocrine/Calcitonin\|calcitonin]]. 

 **4. Calbindin** 

 *   **Function:** Calbindin is another calcium-binding protein, but it has a different role. It acts as a calcium buffer, helping to transport calcium across cells and protecting cells from the damaging effects of high calcium levels. 
 *   **Mechanism:** It's particularly important for calcium absorption in the intestine. In the brain, it's found in certain neurons and is thought to protect them from cell death. 
 *   **Location:** Found in many tissues, including the intestine, kidneys, and brain. 
 *   **Clinical Note:** The production of calbindin in the intestine is stimulated by the active form of vitamin D, calcitriol. 

 **5. Calreticulin** 

 *   **Function:** Calreticulin has a dual role. It's a "chaperone" protein that helps other proteins fold correctly, and it also helps regulate calcium levels within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 
 *   **Mechanism:** It binds to misfolded proteins, preventing them from being sent to the wrong place in the cell. It also binds to calcium in the ER, helping to store it. 
 *   **Location:** Located in the endoplasmic reticulum. 
 *   **Clinical Note:** Calreticulin is involved in the immune response and can be found on the surface of some cancer cells, where it helps the immune system recognize and destroy them. 

 **In a nutshell:** 

 *   **Calsequestrin** "sequesters" (stores) calcium in muscle cells. 
 *   **Calmodulin** is a "modulator" that senses calcium and activates other proteins. 
 *   **Calcitonin** "tones down" calcium levels in the blood. 
 *   **Calbindin** "binds" to calcium to transport it and protect cells. 
 *   **Calreticulin** works in the endoplasmic "reticulum" to fold proteins and store calcium.
