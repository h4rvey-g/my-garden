- **[[USMLE/Neurology/Multiple sclerosis\|Multiple Sclerosis]] (MS):** **Uhthoff Phenomenon** - Temporary worsening of neurological deficits (e.g., vision) due to heat impairing conduction in demyelinated nerves.
- **[[USMLE/Blood/Polycythemia vera\|Polycythemia Vera]] (PV):** **Aquagenic Pruritus** - Intense itching after contact with water (especially hot), often without rash. Linked to mast cell/histamine release. Classic PV symptom.
- **[[USMLE/Blood/Mastocytosis\|Systemic Mastocytosis]]:** Symptoms like **flushing, hives, itching, GI distress, syncope** triggered by heat, causing widespread mast cell degranulation and mediator release (histamine).
- **Cholinergic Urticaria:** **Small, punctate hives** triggered by heat/sweating. Caused by acetylcholine stimulating mast cells.
- **Situational Syncope:** Fainting/lightheadedness due to **heat-induced peripheral vasodilation**, leading to decreased venous return and transient cerebral hypoperfusion.
- **Hot Tub Folliculitis:** Pruritic papules/pustules caused by _**[[USMLE/Infective disease/Pseudomonas\|Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]**_ infection from contaminated warm water.
