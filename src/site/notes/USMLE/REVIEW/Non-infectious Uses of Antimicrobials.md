# [[USMLE/Pharmacology/Antibiotics\|Antibiotics]]

*   **Macrolides** (e.g., Azithromycin, Erythromycin)
    *   **Mechanism:** Significant anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-8) and reducing neutrophil migration and activity. Erythromycin also acts as a motilin receptor agonist.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Chronic Respiratory Diseases:** Used in conditions like [[USMLE/Respiratory/Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\|COPD]], [[USMLE/Respiratory/Bronchiectasis\|bronchiectasis]], and diffuse panbronchiolitis to reduce exacerbations and inflammation.
        *   **Gastroparesis:** Erythromycin is used for its prokinetic effect on the GI tract.
        *   **Severe [[USMLE/Respiratory/Asthma\|Asthma]]:** May be used as an add-on therapy in certain phenotypes.

*   **[[USMLE/Infective disease/Tetracyclines\|Tetracyclines]]** (e.g., Doxycycline, Minocycline)
    *   **Mechanism:** Exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in tissue degradation and inflammation. They also suppress angiogenesis and apoptosis.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Dermatology:** [[USMLE/MSK/Acne vulgaris\|Acne vulgaris]] and rosacea (at sub-antimicrobial doses), bullous dermatoses, and pyoderma gangrenosum.
        *   **Rheumatology:** Used as a disease-modifying agent in [[USMLE/MSK/Rheumatoid arthritis\|rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA) and [[USMLE/MSK/Systemic sclerosis\|scleroderma]].
        *   **Ophthalmology:** Treatment of posterior blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction.

*   **Sulfones** (e.g., [[USMLE/Infective disease/Leprosy\|Dapsone]])
    *   **Mechanism:** Primarily anti-inflammatory, thought to work by inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis and function via myeloperoxidase inhibition.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Dermatology:** First-line treatment for [[USMLE/MSK/Dermatitis herpetiformis\|dermatitis herpetiformis]]; also used for other neutrophilic dermatoses like linear IgA bullous dermatosis and pemphigus.

# [[USMLE/Infective disease/Antifungals\|Antifungals]]

While most are used for infections, some with macrolide structures are cornerstones of immunosuppression.

*   **[[USMLE/Immunology/Immunosuppressants\|Calcineurin Inhibitors]]** (e.g., **[[USMLE/Immunology/Immunosuppressants\|Tacrolimus]]**)
    *   **Mechanism:** This macrolide-like drug is a potent immunosuppressant that inhibits calcineurin, thereby blocking T-cell activation and cytokine production.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Transplant Medicine:** Mainstay therapy to prevent solid organ transplant rejection.
        *   **Dermatology:** Used topically (Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus) for atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin conditions.

*   **mTOR Inhibitors** (e.g., **Sirolimus** [Rapamycin])
    *   **Mechanism:** This macrolide-like drug inhibits the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key kinase in cell proliferation, leading to immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative effects.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Transplant Medicine:** Used to prevent organ rejection, often in patients who cannot tolerate calcineurin inhibitors.
        *   **Cardiology:** Coated on coronary stents to prevent restenosis.
        *   **Oncology:** Treatment for certain cancers (e.g., perivascular epithelioid cell tumors).

*   **Azoles** (e.g., Ketoconazole)
    *   **Mechanism:** Inhibits fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes but can also inhibit human steroidogenesis at higher doses.
    *   **Non-Infectious Uses:**
        *   **Endocrinology:** Used as a second- or third-line agent to lower cortisol levels in Cushing's syndrome.

# Antivirals

The use of antiviral drugs for primary non-infectious diseases is **not common or well-established**. Their clinical application is almost exclusively for treating viral infections.

*   **Immunomodulatory Effects:** While some antivirals like remdesivir have been noted to have immunomodulatory effects (e.g., downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines), this is typically studied within the context of treating a viral infection (e.g., COVID-19) and not as a primary therapy for a non-viral inflammatory disease. Research into the broader immunomodulatory potential of antivirals is ongoing.
