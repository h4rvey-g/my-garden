# Epidemiology

# Etiology
>[!tip] 
>The terms "partial" and "complete" refer to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">extent of abnormal tissue growth and the presence or absence of fetal tissue</span>. In a complete mole, no normal tissue is present, whereas in a partial mole, there may be some but it’s still non-viable.
## Complete mole
- Fertilization of an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">empty egg that does not carry any chromosomes</span> by a single sperm
- The (physiological) haploid chromosome set contributed by the sperm is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">subsequently duplicated</span>.
- Fetal karyotypes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">46XX (more common; ∼ 90% of cases)</span>
	- 46XY (less common; ∼ 10% of cases)
## Partial mole
- Fertilization of an egg containing a haploid set of chromosomes with two sperms
- Fetal karyotypes
	- 69XXY
	- 69XXX

# Pathophysiology


---
# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vaginal bleeding during the first trimester</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uterus size greater</span> than normal for gestational age
- Pelvic pressure or pain
- Passage of vesicles with grape-like appearance
- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin\|β-hCG]]-mediated endocrine conditions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Theca lutein cysts</span>
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Hypertensive pregnancy disorders\|Preeclampsia]] (before the 20th week of gestation)
	- Hyperemesis gravidarum
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|Hyperthyroidism]]: Very high amounts of [[USMLE/Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin\|hCG]] may lead to [[USMLE/Endocrine/Hyperthyroidism\|hyperthyroidism]] because the α-subunit of [[USMLE/Reproductive/Human chorionic gonadotropin\|hCG]] structurally resembles TSH.
