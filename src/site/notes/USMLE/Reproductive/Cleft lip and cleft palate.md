Cleft lip and palate involves a disrupted fusion of the 5 embryonic facial prominences (the midline frontonasal prominence, the bilateral maxillary prominences, and the bilateral mandibular prominences)![highresdefault_L24637.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L24637.jpg)![L24779.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L24779.jpg)
- Cleft lip
	- Partial or total failure of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">primary palate</span> formation during the 6–7th week of development
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Failed fusion of the maxillary prominences and medial nasal prominences at the midline</span> 
- Cleft palate
	- Failed formation of the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">secondary palate</span> during the 8–12th week of development
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Failed fusion of either the lateral palatine processes (palatine shelves) or of the palatine shelves with the nasal septum and/or primary palate</span>
