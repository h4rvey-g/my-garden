| Feature              | Mature Teratoma                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Immature Teratoma                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Malignancy**       | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually benign</span>. Malignant transformation is rare, but possible (most commonly to squamous cell carcinoma).                                                                         | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often malignant</span>, can metastasize.                                                                                                                   |
| **Differentiation**  | Well-differentiated, containing mature tissues from all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).  <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Often contains skin, hair, teeth, bone, muscle, and even complex parts.</span> | <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains immature or embryonic tissues</span>, most commonly neuroectoderm (immature neural tissue). May also have immature cartilage and skeletal muscle. |
| **Age of Onset**     | Can occur at any age, but they're most common during reproductive years.                                                                                                                                                                  | Most frequently in the first two decades of life, rare after menopause.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Common Locations** | Most common in ovaries (dermoid cysts) in females and testes in males. Can occur in other midline locations.                                                                                                                              | Ovaries and testes are common sites, can be found in other locations.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Appearance**       | Often cystic, containing a variety of mature tissues.  The predominant type is cystic (Mature Cystic Teratoma or MCT) and it always contains skin, hair, and neural tissues, along with sebaceous materials.                              | Typically larger and more solid, with heterogeneous areas, often including coarse calcifications and small foci of fat.                                                                                    |
| **Prognosis**        | Generally good due to benign nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Depends on grade and stage, generally poorer than mature teratomas.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Genetic**          | Usually a diploid, normal 46, XX karyotype                                                                                                                                                                                                | May have a variety of karyotypes                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratoma)

## Epidemiology	
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common of all germ cell tumors (90% of all cases)</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common [[USMLE/Reproductive/Ovarian cancer\|ovarian tumor]] in women &lt; 30 years</span>
## Clinical features
- Mostly asymptomatic
- Larger tumors may cause:
	- ↑ Abdominal girth
	- Pressure symptoms (e.g., ↑ urinary frequency)
	- Lower abdominal pain
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Predispose to ovarian torsion</span>
## Diagnostics
### Ultrasound appearance
- Heterogeneous mass
- Hyperechoic nodule
- Echogenic shadowing
- Absent internal vascularity and/or fluid-fluid levels
### Histology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Contains somatic tissue (e.g., hair, teeth, sebaceous glands) from any of the three embryonic germ layers:</span>![L1625.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L1625.jpg)
