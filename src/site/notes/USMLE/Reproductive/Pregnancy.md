# Physiological changes during pregnancy
---
## Respiratory system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Oxygen consumption</span> (by approx. 20%)
- ↑ Intraabdominal pressure through uterine growth → [[USMLE/Respiratory/Dyspnea\|dyspnea]] (the diaphragm is displaced upwards → ↓ total lung capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity, and expiratory reserve volume)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progesterone stimulates the respiratory centers in the brain → hyperventilation (to eliminate fetal CO2 more efficiently) → physiological, chronic compensated respiratory alkalosis</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Respiratory/Ventilation\|Ventilation]] is increased primarily ↑ Tidal volume → ↑ minute [[USMLE/Respiratory/Ventilation\|ventilation]]</span>
		- Elevated progesterone levels trigger a sensation of shortness of breath and stimulate the [[USMLE/Neurology/Hypothalamus\|hypothalamus]] to increase respiratory drive.
		- Facilitated by increased diaphragmatic excursion and hormone-induced laxity of the intercostal muscles that allows for enlargement of the thoracic cavity (although the expanding uterus displaces the resting position of the diaphragm upward, diaphragmatic excursion is not impaired).
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ PCO2 (∼ 30 mm Hg)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Slight</span> increase in respiratory rate
## Renal system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Renal plasma flow → ↑ GFR</span> → ↓ BUN and creatinine
	- Increased cardiac output leads to increased renal perfusion.
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Therefore, serum creatinine levels considered normal in nonpregnant patients (eg, 1.0 mg/dL) represent significant renal dysfunction in this population.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Glucose levels in urine: Increased glomerular filtration results in overload of the glucose carrier responsible for its resorption.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Mild proteinuria: Increased GFR and glomerular permeability to albumin</span> increases protein excretion.
## Hematologic system
- ↑ Plasma volume → ↓ hematocrit, especially towards the end of pregnancy (30–34th week of gestation) → dilutional anemia (hemoglobin value rarely drops below 11 g/dL)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypercoagulability is due to an increase in fibrinogen, factor VII, and factor VIII and a decrease in protein S (reduces the risk of intrapartum blood loss).</span>
	- Increased [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|estrogen]] and progesterone levels
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Platelet count → gestational thrombocytopenia</span>
- ↑ RBC mass (increases from 8–10th week of gestation until the end of pregnancy) 
- ↓ Iron and folate levels due to increased vitamin and mineral requirements
## Endocrine system
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Human placental lactogen (hPL)</span>: a hormone synthesized by syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta, which <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">promotes the production of insulin.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal glucose levels</span>: allows glucose to freely cross the placenta for <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">consumption by the fetus for energy</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Causes insulin resistance</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal proteolysis: provides a readily available supply of amino acids for the fetus</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased maternal lipolysis</span>: leads to increased free fatty acids and ketones <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">to provide energy to the mother, preserving glucose and amino acids for the fetus</span>
## Gastrointestinal system
- ↑ Salivation
- ↓ Lower esophageal sphincter tone → gastroesophageal reflux
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ Motility → constipation and bloating</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Progesterone decreases colonic smooth muscle activity and decreases fasting MMCs (migrating myoelectric complex) in the small intestine</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gravid uterus mechanically impedes small intestine transit</span>
- Gallbladder stasis → [[USMLE/GI/gallstones\|gallstones]]
	- Estrogen increases cholesterol secretion into bile
	- Progesterone reduces gallbladder motility
- [[USMLE/GI/Hemorrhoids\|Hemorrhoids]]
	- Gravid uterus increases venous pressure
## Musculoskeletal system
- ↑ Body weight → forward shift in center of gravity → ↑ lumbar lordosis
- ↑ Intraabdominal pressure → diastasis recti; meralgia paresthetica
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Relaxation of the pelvic girdle ligaments and symphysis pubis → pelvic girdle pain, coccygeal pain</span>
	- Due to progesterone and <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">relaxin</span>
		- Relaxin: a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">vasodilating hormone</span> secreted by the corpus luteum, and later, by the placental and decidual membranes. Increases endothelial nitric oxide secretion, which causes vasodilation and decreases vascular resistance and mean arterial pressure, which increases the glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy.
- Fluid retention in tissue → carpal tunnel syndrome

# Placenta
## Microscopic Anatomy (Chorionic Villi)
*   **Functional Unit**: The **chorionic villus** is the core functional unit for exchange.
*   **Villus Structure**: The bulk of the villus consists of a mesenchymal connective tissue core containing fetal capillaries, venules, and macrophages (**Hofbauer cells**).
*   **Trophoblast Layers**: The villi are covered by two layers of trophoblast cells, especially in early pregnancy:
    1.  **Syncytiotrophoblast (Outer Layer)**: A multinucleated, continuous cell layer that covers the villi surface. It is in direct contact with maternal blood in the intervillous space. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">It is responsible for hormone production (e.g., **hCG**, estrogen, progesterone) and nutrient/gas exchange.</span>
    2.  **Cytotrophoblast (Inner Layer / Langhans' Layer)**: A single layer of mitotically active, mononuclear cells located beneath the syncytiotrophoblast. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">They are the stem cells for the syncytiotrophoblast.</span> This layer becomes discontinuous and less prominent in late pregnancy.
