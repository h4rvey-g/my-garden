# Epidemiology
- Incidence 
	- Second most common gynecological cancer (after [[USMLE/Reproductive/Endometrial cancer\|endometrial cancer]])
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Incidence increases with age</span>
- Age
	- Peak incidence: 55–64 years of age

---
# Etiology
The most likely pathogenesis of EOC is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">repeated injury and repair to the ovarian surface, which makes surface epithelial cells susceptible to malignant transformation (ie, acquiring oncogenic mutations).</span>
## Risk factors
- Hormonal factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Elevated number of ovulatory cycles: early menarche and/or late [[USMLE/Reproductive/Menopause\|menopause]]</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nulliparity</span>

## Ovarian germ cell tumors
---
- Subtypes are determined by structural differentiation
	- Extraembryonic differentiation: [[USMLE/Reproductive/Testicular tumors\|yolk sac tumor]]
	- Somatic differentiation: [[USMLE/Reproductive/Teratoma\|teratoma]]
	- No differentiation: dysgerminoma

# Diagnostics
## [[USMLE/Pathology/Tumor markers\|Tumor markers]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**CA-125:** Elevated in >80% of epithelial ovarian cancers. Best used for monitoring treatment response, not for screening (low specificity, can be elevated in endometriosis, PID, fibroids).</span>
	- **Why it's elevated:** CA-125 (Cancer Antigen 125) is a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of coelomic epithelium, from which most epithelial ovarian cancers derive.
- **Germ Cell Tumors:** ↑ hCG (Choriocarcinoma, Dysgerminoma), ↑ AFP (Yolk Sac/Endodermal sinus tumor), ↑ LDH (Dysgerminoma).
	- Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor of **syncytiotrophoblasts and cytotrophoblasts**, the same cells that form the placenta. A primary function of placental syncytiotrophoblasts is to produce hCG to maintain the corpus luteum during pregnancy.
	- Yolk sac tumor is composed of cells that differentiate to resemble the embryonic yolk sac. During early fetal development, the **yolk sac is the primary producer of AFP**.
	- Dysgerminomas are composed of undifferentiated germ cells and are characterized by very rapid growth and cell turnover. LDH is an intracellular enzyme involved in anaerobic glycolysis. **High cell turnover and cell death (necrosis) lead to the release of large amounts of LDH into the circulation.**
- **Sex Cord-Stromal:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↑ Inhibin and estrogen (Granulosa cell tumor)</span>, ↑ testosterone (Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor)
	- This tumor is composed of malignant **granulosa cells**. In a normal menstrual cycle, granulosa cells surround the oocyte within the follicle and produce **inhibin** to provide negative feedback to the pituitary gland, suppressing FSH secretion. They also produce estrogen. A tumor of these cells retains this function, leading to high circulating levels of **inhibin A and B**, which serves as an excellent tumor marker. The excess estrogen can cause endometrial hyperplasia or precocious puberty.
