- Definition: an X-linked dominant disease caused by a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene (fragile X mental retardation 1 gene)</span> during oogenesis. <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">This leads to its hypermethylation, which silences the gene and renders it unable to express its physiological gene product.</span> 
- Epidemiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Second most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (after [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Down syndrome\|trisomy 21]])</span>
	- Most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, as [[USMLE/Biochemistry/Down syndrome\|trisomy 21]] mostly occurs sporadically
- Clinical features: The clinical presentation varies depending on the number of trinucleotide repeats.![Pasted image 20240412105648.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240412105648.png)
	- 50�?00 repeats (premutation): ataxia, primary ovarian insufficiency, tremor
	- 200 repeats (full mutation):
		- Intellectual disability of varying severity
		- Delayed language development
		- Behavioral features: autistic behavior, hyperactivity, anxiety
		- Characteristic facial anomalies 
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Long and narrow face</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Prominent forehead and jaw</span>
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Large everted ears</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypermobile joints</span>
		- In men: postpubertal macroorchidism (enlarged testes; rarely occurs prior to puberty)
		- [[USMLE/Cardiology/Mitral valve prolapse\|Mitral valve prolapse]]: can lead to mitral regurgitation
		- Above-average head circumference
