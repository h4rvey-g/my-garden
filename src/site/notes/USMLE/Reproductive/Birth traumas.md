# Neonatal soft tissue injuries
Soft tissue injuries of the scalp in infants are mostly caused by shearing forces during vacuum or forceps delivery.![Pasted image 20240311172349.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240311172349.png)
- Head molding 
	- Transient deformation of the head into an elongated shape due to external compression of the fetal head as it passes through the birth canal during labor
	- Typically resolves within a few days after the birth
- Caput succedaneum: benign edema of the scalp tissue that extends across the cranial suture lines
- Cephalohematoma: subperiosteal hematoma that is limited to cranial suture lines  
	- Complications: calcification of the hematoma, secondary infection
	- No treatment required; resolves within several weeks or months
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Subgaleal hemorrhage </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rupture of the emissary veins and bleeding between the periosteum of the skull and the aponeurosis that may extend across the suture lines</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated with a high risk of significant hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock</span>
