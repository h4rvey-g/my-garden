# Epidemiology
---
Peak incidence: neonatal period (first 30 days of life) and during puberty (10�?4 years)

# Etiology
---
- Idiopathic
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Iatrogenic</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Following a testicular procedure with incorrect positioning of testis</span>

# Pathophysiology
---
- Testicular torsion is a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sudden twisting of the spermatic cord (and vascular pedicle) associated with a poorly secured testis.</span>
	- Because of a congenital abnormality in which the tunica vaginalis attaches to the superior pole of the testis (bell-clapper deformity) �?increased mobility of testis within tunica vaginalis, with possible abnormal transverse lie of testis �?torsion of the testis (along the spermatic cord)![Pasted image 20240216092916.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240216092916.png)
- Torsion results in venous engorgement with consequent arterial compromise, tissue ischemia, and possible infarction.
- Irreversible damage occurs after 6�?2 hours of torsion.

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abrupt onset of severe testicular pain and/or pain in the lower abdomen</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">swollen and tender testis</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Nausea and vomiting</span>
- Abnormal position of the testis
	- Scrotal elevation (high-riding testis)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Absent cremasteric reflex</span>
	- Impairment of nerves within the cord
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Negative Prehn sign</span>
	- A physical examination finding in which elevation of the scrotum relieves testicular pain. A positive Prehn sign is associated with [[USMLE/Reproductive/Epididymitis\|epididymitis]]; a negative Prehn sign is associated with testicular torsion.
	- Elevation of the scrotum can improve venous drainage and relieve edema in [[USMLE/Reproductive/Epididymitis\|epididymitis]]; but <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cannot relieve ischemia in testicular torsion.</span>
