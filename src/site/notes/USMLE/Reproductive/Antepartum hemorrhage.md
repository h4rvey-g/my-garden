# Placental abruption
---
The partial or complete separation of the placenta from the uterus prior to delivery; subsequent hemorrhage occurs from both maternal and fetal vessels.
## Epidemiology
- Occurs most often in the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">third trimester</span>
## Etiology
- Vascular changes
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Hypertension (most common cause)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Preeclampsia/eclampsia</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">(Abdominal) trauma</span>: e.g., car accidents, falls, intimate partner violence
- Twin pregnancy
- Sudden decrease in intrauterine pressure ; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decompression of an overdistended uterus (e.g., ruptured membranes in polyhydramnios)</span>
- Previous abruption, chorioamnionitis, short umbilical cord
- Maternal age: < 20 years and > 35 years 
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alcohol and cigarette consumption, cocaine use</span>
## Clinical features
- Maternal symptoms
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden onset of continuous vaginal bleeding</span> (revealed abruptio placentae)
	- In up to 20% of cases, the hemorrhage is mainly retroplacental and vaginal bleeding does not occur (concealed abruptio placentae).![[Pasted image 20250227155447.png\|Pasted image 20250227155447.png]]
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden onset of abdominal pain or back pain</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Uterine tenderness</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fetal distress</span> (60% of cases)
	- Decelerations on fetal heart monitor
# Placenta previa
---
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Presence of the placenta in the lower uterine segment</span>, which can lead to partial or full obstruction of the internal os; high risk of hemorrhage (rupture of placental vessels) and birth complications
## Risk factors
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Maternal age > 35 years, multiparity</span>, short intervals between pregnancies
- Previous curettage or cesarean delivery
- Previous placenta previa, previous/recurrent abortions
## Classification
![[Pasted image 20250227161216.png\|Pasted image 20250227161216.png]]
- Placenta previa: placenta either partially or completely covers the internal os
	- Previously, this category included marginal previa (placenta reaching the internal os), partial previa (placenta partially covering the internal os), and complete previa (placenta completely covering the internal os); these terms have been excluded from the new classification. 
- Low-lying placenta: lower edge of the placenta lies less than 2 cm from the internal cervical os
## Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Sudden, painless, bright red vaginal bleeding</span>
- Usually occurs during the 3rd trimester (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">before rupture of the membranes</span>)
- Initial bleeding episodes are often <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">self-limited</span> and recur during the onset of labor
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Soft, nontender uterus</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Usually no fetal distress </span>
## Treatment
- **Asymptomatic/Stable:** Expectant management with pelvic rest (no intercourse, no digital exams), and serial ultrasounds. Corticosteroids (e.g., betamethasone) are given for fetal lung maturity if <34 weeks.
- **Active Bleeding:**
    - **Unstable mother or fetus:** Immediate C-section regardless of gestational age.
    - **Stable mother and fetus (>36 weeks):** Scheduled C-section is the standard mode of delivery.
- **Never deliver vaginally** if there's a complete previa.
- IV access with large-bore cannulas, blood type and crossmatch are essential due to hemorrhage risk.
# Vasa previa
---
Condition in which the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fetal vessels are located in the membranes near the internal os of the cervix</span>, putting them at risk of injury if the membranes rupture
## Etiology
- Placental anomalies, such as:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Velamentous umbilical cord insertion </span>![Pasted image 20240312161339.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240312161339.png)
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Inserts in chorioamniotic membrane rather than placenta → fetal vessels travel to placenta unprotected by Wharton jelly</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bilobate or succenturiate placenta</span>
		- Variation of the placental morphology with one or more accessory lobes developing separately from the main placental body
## Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Painless vaginal bleeding (fetal blood) that occurs suddenly after rupture of membranes</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Fetal distress (e.g., fetal bradycardia</span>; decelerations or sinusoidal pattern on fetal heart tracings)
- Fetal death can occur quickly through exsanguination or asphyxiation if fetal vessels are compressed during labor.
