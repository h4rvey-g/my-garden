# Klinefelter syndrome
---
## Epidemiology
- One of the most common causes of <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">male [[USMLE/Reproductive/Hypogonadism\|hypogonadism]]</span>

## Etiology
- Associated with advanced maternal age

## Pathophysiology
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">47,XXY</span> (rarely 48,XXXY or 48,XXYY)
	- Presence of a Barr body (inactivated X chromosome)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testicular dysgenesis</span> leads to:
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Seminiferous tubules dysgenesis → loss of Sertoli cells → ↓ inhibin B → ↑ FSH</span>
	- Leydig cell dysfunction → ↓ testosterone → ↑ LH
- Both ↑ LH and ↑ FSH lead to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen.</span>

## Clinical features
![Pasted image 20240207164358.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240207164358.png)
- Eunuchoid growth pattern: tall, slim stature with long extremities (Growth plate closure is delayed )
- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Gynecomastia\|Gynecomastia]]
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Testicular atrophy</span>

# Turner syndrome
---
## Pathophysiology
 - Chromosomal nondisjunction → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">chromosome X</span> monosomy/mosaicism → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">impaired ovarian development → malfunctioning streak gonads with connective tissue instead of normal germ cells → [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|estrogen]] and progesterone deficiencies</span>
	 - The <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">absence of a second X chromosome disrupts X-linked survival signals, causing primordial germ cells to undergo accelerated apoptosis, leading to near-total germ cell loss by birth. Without germ cells, ovarian structures (e.g., follicles) fail to develop, and regressing gonadal ridges are replaced by fibrous connective tissue</span>, forming non-functional streak gonads.
- Karyotype
	- Meiotic nondisjunction (most often in paternal gametes) → complete sex chromosomal monosomy (<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">45,XO</span>; no Barr body)
		- Barr body: The inactive X chromosome present in all female somatic cells. Appears as a small, dark-staining spot at the periphery of the nucleus. Consists of tightly-packed, transcriptionally-inactive, heterochromatin.
	- Mitotic nondisjunction of an embryonic cell → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">sex chromosomal mosaicism (45,XO/46,XX)</span> → mild phenotypic expression

# Kallmann syndrome
---
## Etiology
[[USMLE/Reproductive/Hypogonadism\|Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism]] with hyposmia/anosmia

## Pathophysiology
- Defective migration of GnRH-releasing neurons from the olfactory bulbs to the hypothalamic preoptic nuclei → <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">↓ GnRH secretion</span> and underdevelopment of the olfactory bulbs
- ↓ GnRH → ↓ pituitary secretion of FSH and LH → ↓ testosterone in male individuals and ↓ estrogen in female individuals

## Clinical features
![L18599.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L18599.jpg)
- Anosmia or hyposmia
- Infertility

# Androgen insensitivity syndrome
---
- Pathophysiology
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Dysfunction of the AR in the hypothalamus and pituitary leads to loss of feedback inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), FSH, and LH.</span>  This results in the following hormonal findings:
		- GnRH induces <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">increased LH secretion, which leads to increased testosterone production in the testes.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">FSH secretion is increased by GnRH but suppressed by inhibin from the seminiferous tubules and is often normal.</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Estrogen, which is derived by aromatization of testosterone, may be normal or elevated.</span>
- Diagnostics
	- Clinical presentation
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Before puberty: ↑ testosterone</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">After puberty: ↑ LH, ↑ estrogen, and normal/↑ testosterone levels (no virilization)</span> 
	- Genetic testing
# SRY Gene Translocation
---
- **SRY Gene Function:** The Sex-determining Region Y (SRY) gene, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">located on the Y chromosome, is the primary trigger for male sex determination.</span> It codes for a protein (testis-determining factor) that initiates the development of testes from the bipotential embryonic gonads.
- **Patho/Etiology:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Abnormal crossing-over during paternal meiosis moves the **SRY gene** from the Y to the X chromosome.</span>
    
    - <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">**46,XX Testicular DSD:** Individual is XX but has the SRY gene, leading to a **male phenotype**.</span>
    - **46,XY Gonadal Dysgenesis (Swyer Syndrome):** Individual is XY but has a deleted/mutated SRY gene, leading to a **female phenotype** due to lack of testes development.
- **Presentation:**
    
    - **46,XX Male:** Presents with small testes, gynecomastia, and **infertility**. Phenotypically male.
    - **46,XY Female (Swyer):** Presents with **primary amenorrhea** and lack of secondary sex characteristics. Has a uterus but **streak gonads**. Phenotypically female.
- **Dx:**
    
    - **Karyotype** shows discordance between genotype (e.g., 46,XX) and phenotype (male).
    - **FISH or PCR** confirms SRY gene presence on X-chromosome (in 46,XX male) or its absence/mutation (in 46,XY female).
    - **Hormones:** Elevated LH/FSH. Low testosterone (XX male) or low estrogen (XY female).
- **Mgmt:**
    
    - **46,XX Male:** Testosterone replacement for virilization.
    - **46,XY Female (Swyer):** Estrogen/progestin HRT for female development. **Prophylactic gonadectomy** is crucial due to high risk of gonadoblastoma.
- **Key Complications:**
    
    - **Infertility** (universal).
    - **Gonadoblastoma** risk in the streak gonads of 46,XY Swyer Syndrome.
    - Psychosocial distress.
# Treatment
---
- **Hormone Therapy:** Often essential.
	- **For 46,XY DSDs** (like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, 5-alpha reductase deficiency, Swyer Syndrome): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Estrogen or testosterone may be used depending on the specific condition and gender identity.</span> <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Gonadectomy (removal of testes) is common in AIS and Swyer Syndrome due to cancer risk.</span>
	- **For 46,XX DSDs** (like Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, Aromatase Deficiency, 46,XX Testicular DSD): Corticosteroids are vital for CAH. Estrogen is used for conditions like Aromatase Deficiency and XX Gonadal Dysgenesis. Testosterone may be used for 46,XX Testicular DSD.
	- **For Sex Chromosome DSDs:** <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Growth hormone and estrogen for Turner Syndrome (45,XO); testosterone for Klinefelter Syndrome (47,XXY).</span>
- **Specific Interventions:**
	- **Kallmann Syndrome:** Hormone replacement to induce puberty.
	- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH):** Lifelong corticosteroids to manage hormone imbalances.
	- **Ovotesticular DSD:** Individualized hormone therapy and surgery based on gonadal tissue and gender identity.
	- **Double Y Syndrome (47,XYY):** No direct cure; treatment is supportive (e.g., speech therapy).
