# hCG physiology
- hCG is produced during [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|pregnancy]], primarily by the placental <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">syncytiotrophoblast</span>.
- The role of hCG is to:  
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Stimulate progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum during the first 3–6 weeks of gestation to maintain pregnancy</span>  
		- Prior to pregnancy, LH stimulates corpus luteal progesterone secretion.  
		- After the luteal placental shift, the placenta produces progesterone.
			- The time period around <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">weeks 6-7 of gestation</span>, in which the function of the corpus luteum declines and the production of progesterone gradually shifts from the corpus luteum to the placenta.
	- Promote uterine angiogenesis
	- Promote myometrial stability, preventing contractions prior to labor
	- Support immune tolerance to the growing embryo 
- Structure
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">α-subunit: common to hCG, FSH, LH, and TSH </span>
	- β-subunit
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Specific to hCG </span>
		- Pregnancy tests generally detect hCG through antibodies to the β-subunit.
# Types of pregnancy tests
![Pasted image 20240311145801.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240311145801.png)
- hCG begins being produced by syncytiotrophoblast after invasion of endometrial connective tissue 6-7 days after fertilization
- Serum level at 8 days is <5 IU/L, once serum is 20 IU/L this can be detected in a urine pregnancy test (~14 days following fertilization)
