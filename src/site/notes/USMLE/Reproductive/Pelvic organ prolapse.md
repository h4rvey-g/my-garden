# Etiology
- Etiology: insufficiency of the pelvic floor muscles and the ligamentous supportive structure of the uterus and vagina![highresdefault_L59081.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L59081.jpg)
- Risk factors: 
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Multiple vaginal deliveries and/or traumatic births (greatest risk factor) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Low estrogen levels (e.g., during [[USMLE/Reproductive/Menopause\|menopause]])</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Increased intraabdominal pressure</span> (due to, e.g., <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">obesity</span>, cough related to chronic lung disease and/or smoking, ascites, pelvic tumors, constipation)

# Pathophysiology
- Specific sites ![Pasted image 20240206105327.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020240206105327.png)
	- Vaginal wall prolapse
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Anterior vaginal wall prolapse</span>: herniated anterior vaginal wall, which is often associated with a <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">cystocele (descent of the bladder)</span> or urethrocele (descent of the urethra); can be due to weakness of the pubocervical fascia; <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common type.</span>
		- Posterior vaginal wall prolapse: herniated posterior vaginal wall, which is associated with a rectocele (descent of the rectum) or enterocele (herniated section of the intestines); can be due to weakness of the rectovaginal fascia
	- Uterine prolapse: descent of the uterus
	- Vaginal vault prolapse: descent of the apex of the vagina
	- Apical compartment prolapse: herniated uterus, cervix, or vaginal vault
	- Uterine procidentia: protrusion of all vaginal walls or cervix beyond the vaginal introitus

# Clinical features
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Feeling of pressure on or discomfort around the perineum (“sensation of vaginal fullness”)</span>
- Lower back and pelvic pain (may become worse with prolonged standing or walking)
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Rectal fullness, constipation, incomplete rectal emptying</span>
- Prolapse of the anterior (most common) or the posterior vaginal wall
- Weakened pelvic floor muscle and anal sphincter tone
