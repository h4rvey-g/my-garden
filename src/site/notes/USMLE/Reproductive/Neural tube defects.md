# Etiology
---
- Maternal risk factors
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Folate deficiency during pregnancy</span> due to:
		- Insufficient folate supplementation
		- Drugs that interfere with folate metabolism
			- Methotrexate
			- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|Anticonvulsants]]: [[USMLE/Neurology/Anticonvulsant drugs\|valproate]], carbamazepine</span>
			- Sulfonamides, trimethoprim
- Pregestational [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|diabetes mellitus]]
# Closed spinal dysraphism

## Spina bifida occulta
- Description
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Most common closed NTD</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Cause: failure of vertebral arch fusion</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Vertebral bone defect without herniation</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">The spinal cord, meninges, and overlying skin remain intact.</span>
- Clinical features
	- Most commonly affects the lower lumbar or sacral region 
	- Often asymptomatic (may be an incidental finding in imaging)
	- Possible symptoms at the level of the vertebral defect:
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Lumbar skin dimple</span>
		- Collection of fat
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Patch of hair</span>
- Diagnostics
	- Normal [[USMLE/Reproductive/Alpha fetoprotein\|AFP]]

# Diagnostics
---
## Prenatal period 
- Screening test (16�?8 weeks' gestation): <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">�?[[USMLE/Reproductive/Alpha fetoprotein\|AFP]] in maternal serum (MSAFP) </span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">MSAFP is only elevated in open NTDs.</span>
		- Because the fetal tissues (which are producing AFP) are directly exposed to the amniotic fluid, there is a significantly increased <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">leakage of AFP from the fetus into the amniotic fluid</span>.
	- MSAFP is not elevated in spina bifida occulta. 
- Ultrasonography (18�?0 weeks' gestation) 
	- Characteristic findings depend on the specific defect. 
		- Findings in anencephaly
			- Cranial vault and brain tissue are absent.
			- Residual, disorganized cerebellar and/or brainstem tissue may be present.
			- Bulging eyes and underdeveloped forehead
			- Associated with polyhydramnios
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Amniocentesis: �?AFP and �?AChE in amniotic fluid (increase in open NTDs only)</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">During fetal development, AChE is present in the developing nervous system tissues, including the neural tube.</span>
	- Used as confirmation test when MSAFP is elevated but ultrasound findings are inconclusive
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">When both AFP and AChE are elevated, an open NTD is very likely.</span>
