# Phases
![Pasted image 20250713104847.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250713104847.png)
## 1. Genetic & Gonadal Differentiation (Weeks 1-7)

*   **Indifferent Stage (until ~wk 7):** Embryo has both **mesonephric (Wolffian)** and **paramesonephric (Müllerian)** ducts. Gonads are bipotential.
*   **Genetic Sex** is determined at fertilization (XX or XY).

## 2. Male Development

*   **Key Driver:** **SRY gene** on Y chromosome encodes for **Testis-Determining Factor (TDF)**.
*   **TDF** → Primitive gonads develop into **testes**.
*   Testicular cells differentiate:
    *   **Sertoli cells:** Produce **Müllerian Inhibitory Substance (MIS)**, also known as Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH).
        *   **Function:** Causes involution/degeneration of the **paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts**.
        *   *Absence of MIS → female internal structures develop.*
    *   **[[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Leydig cells]]:** Secrete **testosterone**.
        *   **Function:** Stimulates development of the **mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts** into male internal structures: **S**eminal vesicles, **E**pididymis, **E**jaculatory duct, **D**uctus deferens (**SEED**).
*   **External Genitalia:** Testosterone is converted to **dihydrotestosterone (DHT)** by **5α-reductase**. DHT is responsible for the development of male external genitalia (penis, scrotum) and prostate.

## 3. Female Development

*   **Key Driver:** **Absence** of the SRY gene. Considered the "default" pathway.
*   **Gonads:** Primitive gonads develop into **ovaries**.
*   **Ductal System:**
    *   No MIS/AMH from Sertoli cells → **Paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts** persist and develop into female internal structures: **Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper 1/3 of the vagina**.
    *   No testosterone from [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|Leydig cells]] → **Mesonephric (Wolffian) ducts** degenerate.
*   **External Genitalia:** Develop in the absence of DHT. The genital tubercle becomes the clitoris, urethral folds become the labia minora, and labioscrotal swellings become the labia majora.

## 4. Summary of Homologous Structures

| **Indifferent Structure** | **Male Derivative (stimulated by Androgens)** | **Female Derivative (default)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gonad** | Testis | Ovary |
| **Genital Tubercle** | Glans penis, Corpus cavernosum/spongiosum | Glans clitoris, Vestibular bulbs |
| **Urogenital Sinus** | Bladder, Urethra, Prostate, Bulbourethral glands | Bladder, Urethra, Lower 2/3 of vagina, Bartholin glands |
| **Urogenital Folds** | Ventral shaft of penis (penile urethra) | Labia minora |
| **Labioscrotal Swellings** | Scrotum | Labia majora |
| **Gubernaculum** | Anchors testes to scrotum | Ovarian ligament, Round ligament of uterus |

# Uterine (Müllerian duct) anomalies

- **General Impact**
    - ↓ fertility and ↑ risk of complicated pregnancy (eg, spontaneous abortion, prematurity, Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR), malpresentation).
- **Diagnosis**
    - Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) can demonstrate uterine cavity shape and confirms tubal patency (via intraperitoneal spill of contrast).
    - MRI is often the best imaging modality to differentiate specific anomalies.
## Specific Anomalies
![Pasted image 20250713104154.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250713104154.png)
- **Septate uterus**
    
    - **Patho:** Incomplete resorption of the median septum after fusion of the Müllerian ducts.
    - **Notes:** Most common Müllerian anomaly. Associated with the **highest risk of miscarriage**.
    - **Tx:** Hysteroscopic septoplasty.
- **Bicornuate uterus**
    
    - **Patho:** Incomplete fusion of the Müllerian ducts.
    - **Notes:** Results in a heart-shaped uterus with two horns.
- **Uterus didelphys**
    
    - **Patho:** Complete failure of Müllerian duct fusion.
    - **Notes:** Results in a double uterus, double cervix, and often a double vagina.
