# Definition
---
- Preeclampsia: new-onset gestational hypertension with proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction 
	- Superimposed preeclampsia: preeclampsia that occurs in a patient with chronic hypertension
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">HELLP syndrome</span>
		- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">A life-threatening form of preeclampsia characterized by Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets</span>
		- May occur without hypertension or proteinuria 
	- Occurrence of new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, or end-organ dysfunction at < 20 weeks' gestation is suggestive of gestational trophoblastic disease.
- Eclampsia: new-onset seizures (tonic-clonic, focal, or multifocal) in the absence of other causes ; a convulsive manifestation of hypertensive pregnancy disorders
# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology


---
# Pathophysiology
- Abnormal placental development, specifically inadequate remodeling of spiral arteries, leads to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">placental ischemia</span>.
- This ischemia triggers the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">release of anti-angiogenic factors (like sFlt-1) and inflammatory cytokines, causing widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction.</span>
- The result is <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">systemic vasoconstriction (causing hypertension), increased vascular permeability (leading to proteinuria and edema), and a pro-coagulant state.</span>
- Kidney
	- Third spacing (ie, intravascular volume depletion) and vasoconstriction of the renal vessels result in <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">decreased urine production (ie, oliguria) and concentrated urine (ie, increased specific gravity) because the kidneys attempt to retain sodium and water.</span>
	- Damage to the renal endothelium increases glomerular permeability and allows for leakage of large molecules, as evidenced by proteinuria, which is classic for preeclampsia.
	- Renal vasoconstriction causes a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and an increased serum creatinine level (above baseline).  Healthy pregnant patients have decreased baseline serum creatinine levels due to blood volume expansion and increased GFR; therefore, a normal-appearing creatinine level (0.7-0.9 mg/dL) during pregnancy, as seen in this patient, typically indicates renal compromise.

# Clinical features

# Diagnostics
## Urine studies
In the kidneys, vasospasm causes decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, leading to <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">minimal, concentrated urine (ie, high specific gravity) and increased serum creatinine levels.</span>
- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">24-hour urine collection (gold standard): proteinuria (urinary protein excretion ≥ 300 mg/day) </span>
- Urine protein:creatinine ratio: ≥ 0.3 
- Urine dipstick: > 2+ protein
- Increased serum creatinine level: Healthy pregnant patients have decreased baseline serum creatinine levels due to blood volume expansion and increased GFR; therefore, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">a normal-appearing creatinine level (0.7-0.9 mg/dL) during pregnancy typically indicates renal compromise.</span> See [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy#Renal system\|Pregnancy#Renal system]].
