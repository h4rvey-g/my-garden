# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
## Nonmodifiable risk factors
- History of preterm birth (greatest risk factor)
- Cervical insufficiency
- Short cervical length
- Multiple gestations
## Modifiable risk factors
- Maternal and fetal conditions
	- Infections (e.g., [[USMLE/Renal/Urinary tract infections\|urinary tract infections]], STIs, vaginal infections )
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Hypertensive pregnancy disorders\|Hypertensive pregnancy disorders]] (e.g., preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome)
	- [[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]], [[USMLE/Reproductive/Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy\|gestational diabetes]]
- Lifestyle and environmental factors
	- Smoking
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Substance use (e.g., heavy alcohol use, heroin, cocaine)</span>
	- Maternal or fetal stress
	- Maternal age (≤ 18 years, > 35 years)

## Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)
- Definition: <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Bleeding into the ventricles from the germinal matrix</span>, a highly vascularized region within the subventricular zone of the brain from which cells migrate out during brain development. 
- Etiology: associated with a number of risk factors
	- Birth weight < 1500 g and delivery before 32 weeks' gestation due to the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">fragility of the germinal matrix and/or impaired autoregulation of blood pressure</span>
	- Maternal chorioamnionitis
- Pathophysiology![L10942.jpg](/img/user/appendix/L10942.jpg)
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Immaturity of the basal lamina and lack of astrocytic glial fibrillary acidic protein within the germinal matrix leads to abnormal cerebral autoregulation.</span>
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Alterations in an infant's blood pressure (e.g., during birth, intubation) → failure of cerebral autoregulation to compensate for the change in blood pressure</span> → rupture of and bleeding from vessels in the germinal matrix → rupture of ependyma → blood flows into the ventricles
- Clinical features
	- Usually occurs within the first days of life (up to day 5)
	- Most infants are asymptomatic, but saltatory (for several days) or, more rarely, catastrophic (over minutes to hours) courses are also possible.
	- Lethargy, hypotonia, irregular respirations, seizures,<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)"> bulging anterior fontanelle</span>
	- Cranial nerve abnormalities (e.g., pupils react sluggishly to light) and changes in eye movement (e.g., roving eye movements)
