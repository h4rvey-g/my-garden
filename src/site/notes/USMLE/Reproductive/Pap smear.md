Normal squamous epithelial cells are present. 
- The cells with blue (cyanophilic) cytoplasm on the left of the image are intermediate cells (marked by blue dotted line). 
- The cell with the red (eosinophilic) cytoplasm on the right of the image is a superficial cell (marked by yellow dotted line). 
- Neutrophils can also be seen (small cells with a segmented nucleus).

Pap smear showing low-grade dysplasia
In the center of the image is an <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">irregular clump of koilocytes</span> (marked by an arrow). The koilocytes are characterized by perinuclear halos and show slight nuclear enlargement with irregularly distributed chromatin; they may also exhibit binucleation.

Pap smear showing severe dysplasia
<span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">There is a loosely connected group of abnormal squamous epithelial cells (blue-green cytoplasm). The nuclei are variable in size with a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and there are course clumps of chromatin.</span> The large cell with pink cytoplasm is a normal superficial squamous cell.
