- Definition: failure of one or both testicles to descend to their natural position in the scrotum
	- Testes normally complete their descent into the scrotum by the <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">4th month of life.</span>
# Epidemiology
---


# Etiology
---


# Pathophysiology
---
Inguinal testis: The testicle is located between the external and internal inguinal ring, preventing adequate mobilization (90% of cases).

# Clinical features
---


# Diagnostics
---
- Laboratory tests
	- Testosterone
		- Bilateral cryptorchidism: ↓ testosterone levels
		- Unilateral cryptorchidism: normal levels (normal Leydig cell function)
	- ↓ Inhibin B
	- ↑ FSH, ↑ LH
