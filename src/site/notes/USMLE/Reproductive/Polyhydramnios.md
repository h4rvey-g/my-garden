# Epidemiology


---
# Etiology
- Typically idiopathic (âˆ¼ 70% of cases) 
- Fetal anomalies
	- Gastrointestinal (e.g., esophageal atresia, [[USMLE/GI/Intestinal atresia\|duodenal atresia]] and stenosis): reduced swallowing and absorption of amniotic fluid
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">CNS: anencephaly (leads to impaired swallowing of amniotic fluid, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, and increased urination due to lack of fetal ADH)</span>, meningomyelocele (impaired fetal swallowing, due to Chiari II malformation)
	- Pulmonary: cystic lung malformations
	- [[USMLE/Reproductive/Twinning\|Multiple pregnancy]]: twin-to-twin [[USMLE/Blood/Transfusion\|transfusion]] syndrome 
- Maternal conditions
	- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">[[USMLE/Endocrine/Diabetes mellitus\|Diabetes mellitus]] </span>
		- Increased maternal glucose levels increase fetal glucose levels as well, resulting in polyuria.
	- Rh incompatibility
