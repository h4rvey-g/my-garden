- In utero, the breasts develop from the mammary ridge (milk line), an ectodermal thickening that initially extends from the axilla to the medial thigh bilaterally.

- The remainder of the mammary ridge subsequently regresses in early gestation.

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Incomplete involution of the mammary ridge results in an accessory nipple (sometimes with associated glandular tissue) anywhere along this ridge.</span>![highresdefault_L14814.jpg](/img/user/appendix/highresdefault_L14814.jpg)

- The most common location of an accessory nipple is inferior to the breast.

- Accessory nipples are usually asymptomatic, well-circumscribed, <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">hyperpigmented papules.</span>![Pasted image 20250212205133.png](/img/user/appendix/Pasted%20image%2020250212205133.png)

- They may <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">become larger</span> during puberty, before menses, or with [[USMLE/Reproductive/Pregnancy\|pregnancy]]/lactation <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">due to rising [[USMLE/Reproductive/Androgen and estrogen synthesis\|estrogen]] and progesterone</span> (similar to physiologic changes in normal breast tissue).

- <span style="background:rgba(240, 200, 0, 0.2)">Associated glandular tissue may also become tender or swollen.</span>

- The diagnosis is clinical, and no treatment is generally required.
