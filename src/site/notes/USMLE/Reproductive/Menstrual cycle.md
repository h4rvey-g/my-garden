- **Follicular Phase (Days 1-14):**
    
    - **Early-Mid Follicular:** Low estrogen levels exert **negative feedback** on the hypothalamus and pituitary, inhibiting FSH and LH release to ensure the development of a single dominant follicle. Inhibin B, produced by developing follicles, also selectively inhibits FSH secretion.
    - **Late Follicular (Pre-Ovulatory):** The dominant follicle produces a large amount of estrogen. Once estrogen levels are high and sustained (>200 pg/mL for ~50 hours), it paradoxically exerts **positive feedback** on the pituitary and hypothalamus.
    - **Result:** This positive feedback leads to a massive **LH surge** (and a smaller FSH surge), which triggers ovulation within 24-48 hours.
- **Luteal Phase (Days 14-28):**
    
    - **Corpus Luteum Formation:** After ovulation, the ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which secretes high levels of **progesterone** and moderate levels of estrogen.
    - **Negative Feedback:** The combination of high progesterone and estrogen exerts strong **negative feedback** on the hypothalamus (decreasing GnRH pulse frequency) and pituitary, suppressing both FSH and LH release. This prevents the development of new follicles during this phase.
    - **Result:** If no pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum degenerates, leading to a sharp drop in progesterone and estrogen. This decline removes the negative feedback, allowing GnRH/FSH/LH to rise and initiate a new follicular phase.
